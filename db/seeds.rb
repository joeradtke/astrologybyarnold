  {name: "home", title: "Welcome To Astrology By Arnold", body: "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\n\r\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).", photo_file_name: "5130209bd2ed9_3.jpeg", photo_content_type: "image/jpeg", photo_file_size: 1187844},
  {name: "about", title: "About Astrology By Arnold", body: "Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.\r\n\r\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.\r\n\r\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.", photo_file_name: "512fdfefbd6ac.jpeg", photo_content_type: "image/jpeg", photo_file_size: 639972},

  {name: "introduction", title: "Introduction", body: "<p>\r\nAstrology is the study of the effects of planetary forces upon man. It is not fortune telling. It is one of the best methods for man to learn about who he is, where he came from and where he is going. Astrology reveals CHARACTER and character is destiny. If man can change his character, then man will have changed his destiny. The main uses of astrology are diagnosis of health and sickness, character analysis, vocational guidance, analysis of children's horoscopes so as to give parents a better idea as to how best to raise their children, and analysis of the compatibilities between people.\r\n\r\nAstrology does not show anything but tendencies. A man can rule his stars by exerting his will. If a man decides to flow with the tide of life, then the tendencies indicated in the birth chart will at some time have their effect. The one thing a birth chart does not show is the WILL of the individual and how he may exert it. The matter of exercising free will is left entirely up to the individual. The wise man rules his stars, the fool is ruled by them. Astrology forewarns and being forewarned, a man is thus forearmed to better cope with the struggles of life.\r\n\r\nRemember that good or so-called evil configurations are not the result of chance or luck, but are the product of our own past acts \xC2\x97 the horoscope shows what we have earned by our past living and therefore what we are entitled to in the present life. What we lack in this life can be gained in the future by applying ourselves to the task at hand. The stars IMPEL but do not COMPEL. As Goethe, the great mystic, said, \"From every power that holds the world in chains, Man frees himself when self-control he gains.\"\r\n\r\nThe Law of Consequence (\"Whatsoever a man sows, that he shall also reap\") works in harmony with the planets. The spirit is born into the physical world at that opportune time when the Law and the planets may operate in harmony with each other. The birth of an Ego is so timed by the Lords of Destiny, that the horoscope, which is the clock of destiny, registers the kind of debts which the Ego has incurred in its previous lives, and the time when these debts come to fruition, when the harvest from the seeds which have been sown must be garnered. However, the law of destiny is not a blind law, for it may be modified to a certain degree in proportion to the amount of will power awakened and utilized by the Ego. \"For be not deceived, God is not mocked. The mills of the gods grind exceedingly slow, but they grind exceedingly fine.\"\r\n\r\nThere are three factors which bring to us the mystic message of the stars \xC2\x97 the houses, the signs and the planets. Each house represents a department of life, the signs are divisions of the heavens which by their placement relative to the houses indicate our basic temperament and attitude towards life, and the planets are the messengers of God which by their motion through the houses and signs bring to us the opportunities for soul growth which we need for our individual development. Think of the planets as representing the players in a play. The signs, then, would describe the role that each player has and how he expresses his character, the houses represent the various settings of the play and the angular relationships between the planets, the aspects, represent the plot of the play. Each planet has a characteristic energy. That energy can be expressed either positively or negatively. The way that energy is expressed is determined by the aspects of the other planets to that particular planet.\r\n\r\nThe horoscope shows tendencies only. It is a matter for you to determine how any planetary position will work itself out. That will be determined by the use you make of your own WILLPOWER.\r\n</p>", photo_file_name: nil, photo_content_type: nil, photo_file_size: nil},

  {planetno: 0, houseno: 0, title: "Sun in 1st house", body: "You are important to yourself and will spend much time and energy on your own personal affairs. It's not that you do not care about others, it is just that you have your work to do and it is very important to you. You want to shine and be noticed for who and what you are. You may want to lead or be in a position of dominance. You are confident, independent and responsible. But watch for tendencies to be power-seeking or dictatorial. Be alert to false pride and try to be more humble. Give proper credit to others for their contributions."},
  {planetno: 2, houseno: 0, title: "Mercury in 1st house", body: "You are adaptable, clever, inquisitive, eloquent, witty, and perhaps high-strung. You want to know something about a lot of things. Your speeches and writings reflect your own personal opinions. You may have jittery nerves which keep your body slim, but which could cause nervous disorders. You love talking about what interests you."},
  {planetno: 1, houseno: 0, title: "Moon in 1st house", body: "Moodiness and changeability are keywords for you. These emotions can bring on much indecisiveness, uncertainty, and insecurity. Being self-conscious about your appearance can also bring about mood swings. You are sensitive and perhaps worry too much over what people might think or say about you. Forget about pleasing everyone (it can't be done) and instead focus on doing your best. Develop self-confidence and the courage to be different and don't let it get to you. You can be very sensitive to your environment so do not go to places that might bring up ill feelings or bad memories in you. Your sub-conscious is probably very strong and sometimes quite unmanageable. Be less sensitive to the real or imagined slights of the people around you. Stay positive. You can be quite restless and impulsive. Your mother perhaps affected you greatly as you were growing up. Some of your strengths and many of your weaknesses are probably due to this. Her influence is and may continue to be strong, both for good or ill. Concerning vocation: the emphasis is upon your individuality and doing your own thing. Try to find something that allows you to express your own uniqueness within your work. Find something that you can really put your heart and soul into. Without that deep emotional connection you will simply go through the motions and be unhappy in and with your work. "},
  {planetno: 3, houseno: 0, title: "Venus in 1st house", body: "You are friendly and charming with a magnetic personality. You are the honey in life that draws the bees. You always seem to know what to say with regard to what people want to hear. Whether it is the truth or not is the problem. You have an uncanny ability to attract everything you need in life. People and things just come to you. But, you must guard against using people to get what you want. You enjoy and have an appreciation of beautiful and luxurious things. You can also be quite selfish and self-centered. Acting like the spoiled brat is also a danger."},
  {planetno: 4, houseno: 0, title: "Mars in 1st house", body: "You have an abundance of physical vitality. Sometimes there is so much energy that you become reckless, impulsive, and throw caution to the wind. You may experience cuts and burns on your head and face which may leave some sort of scar. You are assertive, independent, impatient and want to do your own thing. You have strong organizing ability. You are usually self-confident. Guard against accidents due to rushing around in your impulsiveness. You may be subject to higher than normal fevers."},
  {planetno: 5, houseno: 0, title: "Jupiter in 1st house", body: "You are generous, optimistic, cheerful, confident, well-intentioned, with good vitality. You probably like outdoor sports and are good at them. This placement brings many opportunities for personal growth and expansion, including a potential weight problem. Your confidence in yourself makes you a good leader and promoter because you have the ability to inspire the faith of others. You can, however, be extravagant, gullible, over-emotional, egotistical or self-indulgent."},
  {planetno: 6, houseno: 0, title: "Saturn in 1st house", body: "You are probably reserved, quiet, and serious. People may take you for quite a cold person. You are responsible, hard-working and duty comes first on your list of priorities. Self-controlled and disciplined are how others see you. You may have experienced a rather austere or difficult early childhood. Perhaps there was illness that kept you on the sidelines. Feelings of inferiority, insecurity, or unworthiness may push you to great ambitions and accomplishments. Perhaps you feel unloved or that you are not worthy of love. These feelings may have been activated in your early, formative years. Pessimism and depression may come upon you because everything looks like such a struggle for you. Keep your chin up and realize that no hard work is ever wasted and that rewards will come to you later in life if you buckle down now and toe the line. Survival issues may come into play."},
  {planetno: 7, houseno: 0, title: "Uranus in 1st house", body: "You are strong-willed, independent, original, perhaps a bit eccentric, freedom-loving, and intuitive. You have an exciting and stimulating personality which tends to draw people to you. You may be willful, high-strung, nervous, and anxious. You may experience feelings of unrest and loneliness, perhaps because of the uniqueness you feel. Seeking new and unusual ways of expressing traditional ideas appeals to you. Listen to your intuition because it is probably very strong, or could be developed to a high degree. You can become a leader who will pioneer new paths for others to follow. You may be ahead of your time. You may not pay as much attention as you should to your physical state and appearance because of the myriad of thoughts that occupy your mind."},
  {planetno: 8, houseno: 0, title: "Neptune in 1st house", body: "You tend to be artistic, idealistic, dreamy, procrastinating, psychic, and very (hyper)sensitive to your environment. Getting lost in your own imagination can sometimes make you moody, frustrated, unstable or impractical. You may be a sucker for the sob stories of those who feel down and out. You may enjoy playing the role of savior, or of martyr. The day-to-day pressures of the world can drive you away and into your own little world. Be sure you do not get lost in it. You still have to live and function on this earth plane. Your physical body may be susceptible to all sorts of real or imagined ailments. You are like a sponge and can soak up the influences of the environments you are in. So be careful what you surround yourself with. Watch any medicine you take because a little probably goes a long way for you. Perhaps the secret for you is to lose your ego so that you will find yourself."},
  {planetno: 9, houseno: 0, title: "Pluto in 1st house", body: "You are strong-willed, brave, self-sufficient and probably enjoy throwing your weight around. Yet you may lack self-confidence. Controlling others may become an issue for you. You crave experience and transformation. Regeneration is a topic that occupies your thoughts. There is a magnetism that surrounds you that draws other people to you, yet you may be a loner whom others find difficult to understand. You can be gentle and sensitive, yet will always fight for what you believe in. You don't back down from anyone. You are capable of great anger under the right circumstances and when this occurs, you can go off like an A-bomb. You may be a channel for healing and can perhaps develop this ability should you decide. Forgive and forget and don't brood over slights, whether real or imaginary. Trying to be a little more flexible wouldn't hurt either."},
  {planetno: 0, houseno: 1, title: "Sun in 2nd house", body: "You need to feel a strong sense of personal or self-worth. A desire for power through personal possessions, talents and money may engage your energies. Money comes and goes easily. You are generous and ambitious, but can be extravagant and grasping. You must watch a tendency to be possessive of or \"lord over\" people and things. If the Sun is afflicted by aspect, perhaps you do not feel loved or feel worthy of love."},
  {planetno: 1, houseno: 1, title: "Moon in 2nd house", body: "You want and perhaps need to possess both money and possessions for your emotional security. Your feelings and emotional well-being are connected with your material resources. Changes and fluctuations will occur in your financial situation. Perhaps you alternate between being thrifty and careless with your money. Concerning vocation: the emphasis here is on self-worth. You need a work structure that allows public view or access, or working with women or the public. Like a pretty piece of jewelry in a department store window, you should be within the public's view while working. This may not entail working with the public directly, however. You feel as if you need to be seen while working. Becoming one with your work allows you to identify personally and emotionally with some life purpose and to project this to the public at large. Because you so closely identify with your work, your ideas of how successful you are as a person are directly tied in with the success you feel at your work environment."},
  {planetno: 2, houseno: 1, title: "Mercury in 2nd house", body: "You may use your wit, knowledge, and versatility to make money. At the very least you like to talk about money.  It is on your mind. You may earn money with an ability to communicate ideas to others through writing and speaking. You may have financial skill, but your money may come and go, regardless."},
  {planetno: 3, houseno: 1, title: "Venus in 2nd house", body: "You attract money and personal possessions, especially when needed. You spend money as fast as you earn it, sometimes faster. Your hidden talents can be beneficial to others, if you apply yourself. Don't be afraid to work. Your money is used to buy beautiful, artistic, and/or musical things. You like a certain amount of luxury to surround you. Money may come to you through a partner or relationship."},
  {planetno: 4, houseno: 1, title: "Mars in 2nd house", body: "Much energy and action will be expended with respect to money, personal possessions and resources. You may have trouble controlling your spending habits and are likely to be an impulsive shopper. Saving is probably not your strength, but you should try to improve your savings ability. You might sometime need it for that rainy day. Money may come and go in order to de-emphasize its importance. Concentrate on developing your talents instead."},
  {planetno: 5, houseno: 1, title: "Jupiter in 2nd house", body: "You have the ability to be financially successful. Money seems to come to you and you have probably never missed a meal in your life. You have confidence and optimism in your talents and abilities. Your visionary ideas and investments usually prosper due to your intuitive appraisal of situations. You enjoy material possessions and may be termed \"lucky\". You inspire trust in others and may benefit from receiving financial assistance from others in order to develop your visionary and idealistic ideas. You must guard against self-indulgence and over-extravagance. Curb your desire for rich, sweet food and desserts."},
  {planetno: 6, houseno: 1, title: "Saturn in 2nd house", body: "You tend to be thrifty, practical and responsible, especially with money and possessions. This placement does not deny money, but you must work hard for it. Sometimes you are so busy squirreling away money that you forget to enjoy it. Having money set aside for a rainy day is fine, but you probably don't need as much as you tend to want to have set aside. Poverty is possible with this placement due to a lack of understanding of the true value of money and possessions. There is a tendency to become depressed over material matters. Your possessions are apt to bring worries rather than happiness because you may need to learn to share with others. There may have been too much emphasis on materialism in past lives. You may need to re-evaluate your values. Attitudes of possessiveness toward others must be changed. Feelings of being unloved, unwanted, and unappreciated occur with this position. You must value yourself before others can value you. Love yourself first."},
  {planetno: 7, houseno: 1, title: "Uranus in 2nd house", body: "You can earn money in original and inventive ways. Money and possessions come and go in sudden, unexpected ways. There may be unusual and disruptive changes in your financial condition. You may value money for the freedom it gives you to pursue your inner talents, which may be rare and unique. You have the ability to get yourself out of financial difficulties."},
  {planetno: 8, houseno: 1, title: "Neptune in 2nd house", body: "You have a strong imagination and psychic sensitivity which can be used to tap your inner talents. You receive intuitive hunches and are apt to have vivid dreams. You have an appreciation of beautiful objects. You seldom worry about money, which may be just as well, since your finances can be complicated and sometimes confusing. This placement can tend to make you extremely generous or extremely dishonest. If dishonesty is present, you will experience losses through theft, fraud and deception. Do everything on the up-and-up and money matters will go smoother. Avoid risky speculations and investments. Be completely honest with respect to money matters."},
  {planetno: 9, houseno: 1, title: "Pluto in 2nd house", body: "You have financial ability with keen judgment, patience, energy, and will. You may possess unusual talents. This placement may give an inordinate desire for money and possessions. Watch the tendency to view loved ones as possessions. You may see money coming and going in order to de-emphasize its importance. Detachment may be necessary. You must learn to spontaneously share all possessions with others. Integrity in money matters is essential. Others may seek to control your resources and possessions or you may be quite demanding and controlling with your own resources, monetary and otherwise."},
  {planetno: 0, houseno: 2, title: "Sun in 3rd house", body: "Knowledge is important to you and you chase as much of it as possible. You enjoy passing on the knowledge you have gained. Although you are probably very open to new ideas, there yet may be the desire for scientific proof before anything can be believed. Your mind enjoys creating and it is thorough and self-reliant. Pride and intellectual domination may be something you need to work on, especially intellectual pride. Patience may also need developing. Misunderstandings can occur with siblings or neighbors due to your belief that you are always or mostly right. You have a strong desire to learn and this may take you on many short journeys. You need to communicate and there may be writing or speaking ability."},
  {planetno: 1, houseno: 2, title: "Moon in 3rd house", body: "You possess intellectual curiosity and may well express your true feelings through speech, poetry or writing. Intellectualizing your feelings is probable. There is a strong need for communication and for gathering information, which is later shared with people in general or women in particular. You have a fine sense of humor and like to joke and play around. Travel appeals to you because it affords new opportunities for learning. Routine of any kind probably bores you and you are constantly looking for variety. Your ideas change at a moment's notice and you are forever flexible and adaptable to any situation. Learning is perhaps better accomplished through listening rather than reading. Your mind can be quite emotional at times. Concerning vocation: the emphasis is on communication and information exchange. Your personality gathers, shares and reacts to information. This position represents the intermediary, the go-between, and the dissemination functions."},
  {planetno: 2, houseno: 2, title: "Mercury in 3rd house", body: "You are clever, alert, adaptable, versatile and studious. Mercury here stimulates the mind and the body. You can express your ideas fluently and you have the ability to bring your ideas to completion. You are apt to be a jack-of-all-trades. There may be many short journeys. This is a good position for teachers, for those concerned with detailed work, or for work with computers. Writing or speaking ability is present."},
  {planetno: 3, houseno: 2, title: "Venus in 3rd house", body: "You may be artistic and creative in speech and writing and you express yourself well in either. You have a love of travel, yet your immediate surroundings are probably quite harmonious and comfortable. Relations with neighbors and siblings are probably easy-going and pleasurable. Because you dislike inharmony, you avoid confrontations with people in your immediate environment, hating to rock the boat."},
  {planetno: 4, houseno: 2, title: "Mars in 3rd house", body: "You are restless, perhaps high-strung, and probably have an abundance of nervous energy. You have an intense belief in your own ideas. You are alert, determined, and enthusiastic. You possess an abundance of mental energy. Developing analytical thinking is important, as impulsive thinking will bring difficulties. There can be problems with siblings or neighbors. There will be many short journeys. Energy is expended in neighborhood activities."},
  {planetno: 5, houseno: 2, title: "Jupiter in 3rd house", body: "You are philosophical, optimistic, conventional and considerate. You have strong intuition. This position expands and broadens your mind enabling you to comprehend easily. You are well liked by siblings, neighbors and relatives. There may be mental restlessness which can be helped through occupations that keep you moving. You must be careful not to scatter your energies. There is a tendency to be impractical or self-satisfied. Your mind tends to think in broad terms, not in details."},
  {planetno: 6, houseno: 2, title: "Saturn in 3rd house", body: "Your mind is serious, exacting, patient and orderly plus you have the ability to concentrate on deep subject matter. With this ability comes a tendency to depression, pessimism, loneliness or despondency. You have organizational ability and are probably conservative and traditional in your thinking. Mathematics and strategy games may appeal to you. Time consuming projects do not bother you. You may feel a bit isolated from siblings and neighbors or they may give you trouble. There may be issues of communication with either. Try to stay optimistic in your thinking and in the meantime simply keep working hard. Your lungs need plenty of oxygen, so try to sleep in a well-ventilated room."},
  {planetno: 7, houseno: 2, title: "Uranus in 3rd house", body: "Your mind is independent, original, creative, unconventional, curious, perhaps somewhat eccentric, and unusual. People around you sometimes cannot understand how you think or why you express yourself in the ways you do. You may be ahead of your time. Mental restlessness causes you to always be on the search for new information and knowledge. You have unique ways of passing this new information along to others. Frequent changes of mind are likely as new data filters through you. Relationships with siblings and neighbors are likely to be unusual and perhaps somewhat high-strung and tense at times. Boredom is seldom a problem. The desire for fresh experience may cause you to travel extensively. Intellectual freedom is important to you."},
  {planetno: 8, houseno: 2, title: "Neptune in 3rd house", body: "You are idealistic and artistic. Your mind soaks up information rather than acquiring it by brute force. Your ability to visualize and imagine is probably quite pronounced. Flashes of inspiration can come to you quite suddenly. There may even be traces of clairvoyance. Perhaps you have felt as if you could read people's minds? Concentration on book work may be difficult for you. Did you ever try sleeping with the book under your pillow? Possible karmic obligations to siblings or neighbors may need to be reconciled. Some feelings of insecurity may cause nervous disorders. You may have a tendency to be unreliable or negative. Avoid procrastination and idle day-dreaming. Avoid all negative psychic practices and drugs."},
  {planetno: 9, houseno: 2, title: "Pluto in 3rd house", body: "Your mind is versatile, inspired, probing and original. You perhaps have a keen ability to size up people and circumstances. You are probably good at understanding people's true motives. You want to know the answers to all your many questions. Research and figuring out puzzles or brain teasers may appeal to you. Perhaps you enjoy playing detective. You may be searching for that something that will give meaning to your life or searching for that area that will help you regenerate yourself or your thinking. Frustration, depression or anxiety may arise when the answers you seek are not forth-coming. Keep at it! Expressing yourself in writing may help alleviate the tension. This may help purify your thoughts, then allow new thoughts to enter. Once your thoughts and feelings have been purged, you may want to destroy the material as its purpose has been served."},
  {planetno: 0, houseno: 3, title: "Sun in 4th house", body: "You desire to build strong inner and outer foundations, but, at times, you may have the wish to retreat from society when life becomes difficult. The influence of either or both parents is strong for good or otherwise. There is pride in the home and that is where you want to shine and show your creativity. That is where you can be the real you. You want to be king of your castle, but just don't be too demanding at home. No one likes a dictator."},
  {planetno: 1, houseno: 3, title: "Moon in 4th house", body: "There is a strong sense of family and home with this position. A love of antiques perhaps grounds you to your roots. Security is very important to you and you seem to get that through your foundations, your home and family, and your parents. Things collected serve as reminders of the past which you maybe try too hard to hold on to. Many changes of residence can occur until you find your personal foundation or roots. One or both parents are strong in your life. Concerning vocation: the emphasis is on the home. Maybe working in your home would be most fulfilling or maybe you simply need to make your place of work very homey, using photographs, mementos, furniture, etc., to establish the most personal atmosphere. The need during work is for security and comfort. "},
  {planetno: 2, houseno: 3, title: "Mercury in 4th house", body: "You tend to be studious, with literary interests. You like to study at home. Continual studying gives you a sense of inner security. You may be high-strung and need to learn to relax and take a break from all that book work. There can be many changes of residences due to your restlessness and your need to find a place for yourself. Wherever you end up, your home will no doubt contain a study area or a special spot where you can just talk to friends and acquaintances."},
  {planetno: 3, houseno: 3, title: "Venus in 4th house", body: "You desire beautiful things and a nice, rather luxurious home. You have an artistic nature with a talent for making people welcome in your home. Entertaining at home gives you real pleasure. There is a love of family and children. The latter part of life may be pleasant and comfortable, although you may find a tendency to add weight in later life."},
  {planetno: 4, houseno: 3, title: "Mars in 4th house", body: "There is an early striving for independence and a desire for security and a home of your own. There may be tension or antagonism in your family environment. Perhaps you are too demanding of those closest to you. You must overcome your hidden antagonisms and quarrelsomeness. Your strong emotions must be toned down and controlled. Go out and do some yard work to work off the excess energy."},
  {planetno: 5, houseno: 3, title: "Jupiter in 4th house", body: "You are generous, self-confident, hospitable and patriotic. Prosperity usually increases in later years. You desire a home that is spacious and comfortable. Parental influence is strong in shaping your character. Perhaps your parents shared a strong faith with you. Usually, considerable help and/or an inheritance is received from the parents. With Jupiter well-aspected, it is better to stay where you were born rather than move away from your birthplace. Guard against becoming ostentatious and watch out for self-indulgence."},
  {planetno: 6, houseno: 3, title: "Saturn in 4th house", body: "You are probably conservative and perhaps find security in land or real estate or in old, traditional ways, beliefs, things or antiques. You may dislike change because of an unconscious fear of the unknown. You may have a desire to accumulate possessions, for security reasons. There may be many responsibilities and problems in your home or family life. You may be somewhat of a tyrant or strict disciplinarian in your home or with your family. Inner worries may cause ulcers. You may be a caretaker of someone or of your parents, perhaps because of a karmic debt to them. The later part of life can be more rewarding if you learn the lessons life has to teach you in your earlier years. If not, then old age may not be as pleasant."},
  {planetno: 7, houseno: 3, title: "Uranus in 4th house", body: "You may experience unsettled home or family conditions. These events usually happen quite unexpectedly, out of the blue. Your family heritage may be eccentric or unusual and family skeletons can appear. This position gives restlessness, perhaps with a desire to move often. Your parent(s) or your relationship with either parent may be unusual, which will affect you emotionally (nerves) for good or otherwise. There will be many changes in your life, including different localities. You desire to remain free from commitments to either a home or a community. You may be unconventional and not interested in how others view you. Later in life, you may develop an interest in astrology or in metaphysics."},
  {planetno: 8, houseno: 3, title: "Neptune in 4th house", body: "You may experience a sense of inner uncertainty, insecurity and confusion. Unexplainable fears and anxieties may cause you to withdraw from living. You idealize the home environment and it may be, in reality, more in your imagination rather than in fact. A spiritual tie with one or both parents is likely. A desire to live by the sea is not uncommon with this position. You may have vague recollections regarding your true roots and this uncertainty may cause difficulties. Remember, with Neptune, things are not as they appear and you need to face reality in your home environment and with respect to your parents rather than what may be in your imagination and sub-conscious."},
  {planetno: 9, houseno: 3, title: "Pluto in 4th house", body: "You may have a good imagination and intuitive ability. There is a desire for a loving home atmosphere, yet power struggles and a desire to wear the pants in the family may cause problems. The influence of one or both parents is strong for good or ill. Perhaps one or both are manipulative or controlling. You may possess an explosive temper due to the inner tension at home. You may feel restless in the place of your birth. The home may be your place for regeneration."},
  {planetno: 1, houseno: 4, title: "Moon in 5th house", body: "Romances and attachments to children can be decidedly emotional. There is a constant search for pleasure and emotional self-expression. Activities concerning children are pronounced. Too much emphasis may be placed upon having a good time and being the center of attention. There are mood swings and fickleness in love affairs. A heightened desire to feel loved and important may need to be controlled. You are a pleasure-seeking person with a lot of charm. Fluctuating emotions may interfere with your creativity. Concerning vocation: The theatrical, exhibitionist, creative dimensions of the work needs are increased. Teaching and taking care of children are emphasized. Speculation and the dramatizing of all experiences are possible."},
  {planetno: 0, houseno: 4, title: "Sun in 5th house", body: "You have a desire to reveal your creativity, either constructively or destructively. You are interested in all forms of creative self-expression, such as sports, books, acting, the dramatic, games and romance. You have the ability to enjoy life and to give enjoyment to others. Happiness comes from your artistic or creative endeavors. You need to watch a tendency to be dictatorial or to take unnecessary risks."},
  {planetno: 2, houseno: 4, title: "Mercury in 5th house", body: "You have a need to prove your intelligence and to use that intelligence in creating things of a mental nature - mental children, as it were. You desire to pass on your knowledge to others and to learn from them as well. Teaching children or young adults may provide quite a lift for you. Games of strategy and skill challenge your intellect. You desire to communicate your thoughts in a clever, inspiring and dramatic manner. You may have acting, writing, or speaking ability. As a teacher, you enjoy stimulating the minds of others and encouraging your students to greater things. Romances probably need to involve someone with whom you can communicate intelligently and relate to mentally. For you, sexiness is in the brain."},
  {planetno: 3, houseno: 4, title: "Venus in 5th house", body: "You are affectionate, creative and attractive to the opposite sex, perhaps too attractive for your own good. You probably have talent in drama, art, or music and these may be your favorite hobbies. Perhaps there is love of the stage and of performing. You might make a delightful and expressive teacher because of your love of children. You certainly enjoy having a good time and people may consider you a party animal. Over-indulgence needs to be watched."},
  {planetno: 4, houseno: 4, title: "Mars in 5th house", body: "There is a desire to be creative and you will expend much energy in that direction. You may be a gambler, a risk-taker, or a speculator. You are sports-loving and enterprising and like to have a good time. There may be some friction through children due to selfishness in past lives. Attraction to and from the opposite sex is fairly certain. Much energy will probably be directed toward dating and romance."},
  {planetno: 5, houseno: 4, title: "Jupiter in 5th house", body: "Many opportunities for romance, dating, and activities involving children or teaching will probably come your way. You are optimistic and enjoy passing on your knowledge to those around you. You have creative ability which can bring success and happiness. There is a strong desire to make significant contributions through your creative self-expression. Children, which may be plentiful, can be a source of pleasure or over-indulgence. Guard against rash gambling and speculation."},
  {planetno: 6, houseno: 4, title: "Saturn in 5th house", body: "You perhaps feel unloved and unappreciated. Romances can turn cold. Love affairs are serious and you may feel emotionally and creatively inhibited. Because of your emotional restriction, you can appear to be cold, unloving, and unresponsive. This prevents you from being as popular as you would like to be. You have a desire for others to look up to you. It is difficult for you to relax. Personal interests and hobbies need to serve a practical purpose for you in order for you to enjoy them. Parenthood may be a burdensome responsibility and you may be too restrictive towards your kids. It is difficult for you to show your love and appreciation. You need to learn how to express your feelings towards those you love, and not just through the giving of presents and material things. It is important for you to forget yourself and to learn to project warmth to others."},
  {planetno: 7, houseno: 4, title: "Uranus in 5th house", body: "You definitely possess creative originality. Your hobbies are unusual and interesting. Your desire for independence may make love affairs and relationships with children unsettling. Your children may be very unique, so much so that neither you nor they can understand the other. You are disinterested in society's social games and are more concerned about your own inclinations. Speculation can get you into trouble  - be careful. Sudden gain and sudden loss are possible. Unexpected gains without any effort on your part can come to you, which may generate an attitude within that you just can't lose. Watch out for that. Your love life is unusual, sometimes maybe even wild. Your approach to romance and dating may be somewhat cavalier, unconventional and/or rebellious."},
  {planetno: 8, houseno: 4, title: "Neptune in 5th house", body: "You are artistic and creative. You have a flare for the dramatic and perhaps love being \"on stage\". You like playing the role of the entertainer. Chaotic love affairs with much confusion can be experienced or love affairs just seem to dissolve for no particular reason. In matters of love you can be the hopeless romantic or the one who is constantly looking for that white knight or princess to sweep you off your feet. Idealism is fine, but don't lose your practicality or let your imagination run away with you. Your children may be unusual. Perhaps they require some special care. Great sacrifices can be made for children and love interests, but little may be gained in return."},
  {planetno: 9, houseno: 4, title: "Pluto in 5th house", body: "You have unusual talents and hobbies. Great creativity and self-expression is possible. Your children may be unique and it may be difficult for you to understand them or for them to understand you. There may be too much emphasis on sex in romantic relationships and issues of power and control can surface therein. There is an inner drive to be creative and it would be best if this creativity were not channeled through sex. Find a creative hobby instead."},
  {planetno: 0, houseno: 5, title: "Sun in 6th house", body: "You feel a need to serve others or to be of service to them. Or perhaps it's that you simply want to be served yourself. There may be a tendency to wallow in self-pity, seek sympathy for any little thing, or to develop hypochondriac tendencies. You are a faithful, diligent and loyal employee who is usually helpful to fellow employees. Some with this position are domineering and develop a false pride with those they work with or for. You can be an administrator, but you may prefer to be an employee. If you are in a position of authority, be careful not to be the office tyrant. You are very happy when you are busy and you hate being bored. You take great pride in your work and your workplace. This is where you want to shine and be better than all others. Worry and anxiety, especially over the desire to do things perfectly, can be detrimental to your health. You need to learn how to relax and not let stress and tension get to you. With this position you should be especially careful to take good care of your physical body."},
  {planetno: 1, houseno: 5, title: "Moon in 6th house", body: "You are considerate of fellow workers and desire to nurture them in a productive work environment. Service to others is a fine outlet for your personality. Moodiness and sensitivity can be a problem, though. Fluctuations in health are possible, perhaps mostly due to worry and feelings of insecurity. Emotional tension along with digestive troubles indicate the need to relax. Stop worrying. You should not eat when overworked, overtired, or when you are upset. Take care of your health and watch your diet. Concerning vocation: You are probably totally absorbed within your work situation. You can be a workaholic. Many job changes are possible and working with the public or with women is indicated."},
  {planetno: 2, houseno: 5, title: "Mercury in 6th house", body: "You have analytical ability with a possible love of computers and electronics. If you become too concerned with details, your nerves may become frayed, thus causing health problems. Any ill health reflects wrong thinking and perhaps worry. You may be restless with a desire for frequent job changes. Service, possibly of a mental nature, appeals to you. Variety in your work or workplace is important. Issues of health and diet interest you."},
  {planetno: 3, houseno: 5, title: "Venus in 6th house", body: "You are diplomatic, well liked by employees and/or fellow workers and you have a desire to bring about better working conditions for them so that working will be enjoyable. This is a fairly good position for health unless you abuse your body through self-indulgence and rich, sweet food. An excess of sugar and starches should be avoided. You can be the mediator when differences of opinion occur on the job or in the office. You can bring peace and understanding."},
  {planetno: 4, houseno: 5, title: "Mars in 6th house", body: "You are industrious, efficient, tireless, dynamic and active in work. You may have a tendency towards irritation and impatience with co-workers and employees who lack these qualities. You are mechanically minded with good vitality and strong recuperative powers. You tend to run fevers, perhaps higher than normal, when ill. There is a danger of burns, scalds, and accidents sustained in the course of work or employment. Many of these may happen because of impulse, haste, and impatience."},
  {planetno: 5, houseno: 5, title: "Jupiter in 6th house", body: "This placement tends to give good health. Any health problems are usually caused by extravagance and over-indulgence, too much of a good thing. You are helpful to others and are a dependable worker with a sense of loyalty. You inspire cooperation and good will among your fellow workers. You enjoy your work and give of your time willingly. Watch that you do not overwork or overindulge in eating or drinking. There could be difficulties in the liver and blood or poor circulation due to over-indulgence."},
  {planetno: 6, houseno: 5, title: "Saturn in 6th house", body: "Obstructions of or limitations in health can come into play with this position. Diet may need to be watched and improved as your body may not assimilate everything it needs from the food you eat. Perhaps taking vitamins would help in this regard. Exercise would certainly be beneficial. There may be difficulties at the workplace, possibly because of your attitudes toward others. Perhaps the environment is not conducive to your best efforts or perhaps your fellow employees make life miserable for you. You cannot always expect others to work as hard as you or to grasp details as rapidly as you can. You may be a workaholic or you may simply need to learn \"how\" to work. In general, though, you are probably a practical, conscientious, hard worker who can work with details well. You may not be at your best with strict time deadlines, but you do try to always do your duty. Do not overwork to the point of exhaustion. The tendency to worry and to harbor anxieties may affect your health causing depression and perhaps hypochondria."},
  {planetno: 7, houseno: 5, title: "Uranus in 6th house", body: "You have unique abilities and original methods, especially in your work. You may suffer from extreme nervous tension and strange accidents on the job. Your appearance and manner of dress are apt to be quite unusual. You like the kind of work that has irregular hours, is different, and has a lot of variety. You are a good worker, but must watch out so that you do not overwork. You can develop clever ideas which will aid you in your work. You are at your best when you can be independent and be your own boss. You may be impatient with others and can appear to be abrupt to and detached from your fellow workers. Strange and unexpected turns in your health can occur. Spasmodic health is also a possibility. Many times the cause is simply nervousness, anxiety, stress, and tension. Relax."},
  {planetno: 8, houseno: 5, title: "Neptune in 6th house", body: "Strange things can happen at the workplace or to your health. You seek to serve and to perhaps nurse and take care of others. Sometimes it may be difficult for you to get started on your work or to work logically and systematically in order to get the job done. In your work, you may encounter people who are \"two-faced\", causing you pain and suffering. You are extremely sensitive to your workplace conditions and you need pleasant and peaceful surroundings. If these are not present, then you may experience unusual health difficulties, some of which may be real and some of which are only in your head. You are a psychic sponge that absorbs the atmosphere around you. Herbal healing or holistic techniques may work better for you than traditional medical techniques. You are capable of making great sacrifices in your work. Just don't play the martyr."},
  {planetno: 9, houseno: 5, title: "Pluto in 6th house", body: "Great personal transformations can occur because of your work or your workplace environment. You may have the desire to become involved in workplace issues or labor union goings-on. You strive for cooperation and thoroughness in your work habits and you can be a hard taskmaster for fellow employees or for the workers under your command. Guard against trying to be too controlling of how they work. You have the ability to work long hours on nervous energy until your body cannot take any more. You enjoy troubleshooting and solving problems that others cannot solve. Detective work on the job is fun for you. You have the ability to encourage people to discuss deep-seated problems and then analyze the problems logically. There may be an interest in healing. You could be a channel for healing or you might simply be a hypochondriac. You are apt to unconsciously project criticalness to fellow workers without speaking. There may be difficulties through infectious, deep-seated diseases or problems in the colon area."},
  {planetno: 0, houseno: 6, title: "Sun in 7th house", body: "You want a partner that you can be proud of. In some way your sense of pride is involved in the choosing of a marriage partner. There may be a wish to gain social prestige and to marry someone who can be admired and respected or someone who is higher on the social ladder.\r\n\r\nYour partner must be one who encourages you to be your real self and one who wants you to fully develop your powers of inspiration, creativity and will. Your partner may be in a position of authority and this may help give you more confidence in yourself or more security within the framework of the relationship. You may be challenged to display a greater degree of confidence and to exercise authority more effectively and with greater magnanimity.\r\n\r\nYou must seek a relationship where both people are equal. A partnership in which one is \"superior\" and the other \"inferior\" is not likely to be successful. That \"always me-first\" attitude is not conducive to a rewarding partnership. A need to feel part of a family is present.\r\n\r\nWith this position marriage and partnerships are likely to assume a paramount and key role in your life. There may be a tendency to look for a \"father figure\" and, as you may be inclined to surrender the initiative to your partner, you are rather more likely to react than act first yourself, so that your partner may assume a dominant role.\r\n\r\nIf your natal Sun is badly aspected, then the partners you attract may be egotistical, domineering, vain and ostentatious. If your natal Sun is well aspected, then partners are likely to be proud, firm-minded, self-confident, ambitious, honorable, frank and generous.\r\n\r\nSelfish pride and too much desire to have your own way may be the greatest challenges in your relationships."},
  {planetno: 1, houseno: 6, title: "Moon in 7th house", body: "You seem to attract sensitive people as partners, perhaps those who want to \"mother\" you or be mothered. There can be many changes of partners and many relationships because of the need to find someone who can bring an ultimate security. This search continues because security can only be found within, not without. You desire companionship, hence many relationships.\r\n\r\nYour feelings are greatly influenced by those with whom you are in close personal contact. You want to be popular with others. You are inclined to seek partners who can bring out your sympathetic side and play on your emotions.\r\n\r\nFor men there is often a tendency to seek a \"mother figure\" and to bring out in others a desire to mother, protect and care for them. You are therefore likely to attract a partner who is kind and domesticated.\r\n\r\nBoth you and your partner may need to be on your guard against moody or fickle behavior. Marriage may be undertaken with the object of establishing a home. More than one marriage is possible.\r\n\r\nThere is probably a compelling emotional need for a partner and for marriage. In order to get the best results from any partnership you must learn to control any tendency to be continually at the mercy of your moods, which may result from over-vulnerable feelings. Try to control a tendency to be too dependent on others for your emotional stimuli and you should discipline a constant desire for changes in the nature of the relationship.\r\n\r\nConcerning vocation: Your work situation is tied to the public, partnerships, a keen awareness of public expectation and the need to meet it. Perhaps marriage is essential to give clear focus to work security. For many with this position, the work profile can be labeled a \"public personality.\" You are dependent upon others for the fulfillment of work needs. The process of relationships is extremely important."},
  {planetno: 2, houseno: 6, title: "Mercury in 7th house", body: "Your relationships tend to gravitate towards people who are intelligent, thought-provoking, witty and learned. You desire your spouse or business partner to be sharp, curious, clever and alert. You need to communicate and exchange ideas and information with your partner. Promotion of ideas to and from others appeals to you and you are always up for a good debate, discussion or argument.\r\n\r\nYou may spend much time thinking about your relationship or relationships in general. Marriage may be quite often on your mind. You desire a marriage or business partner that provides you with mental satisfaction and challenge. A partner who challenges you mentally and one who helps you function on more of an intellectual level is what you are looking for and need. Their value is enhanced if they help you better adapt and more effectively communicate with others. The person who gives you a lively flow of ideas, ideas that challenge and test your own mental processes, one who brings out your best mentally, stimulates you in a way that others may not understand. Yet that is what you seek in a partner.\r\n\r\nYour partner may be quick-witted, fluent, volatile, restless, high-strung as well as outspoken, argumentative, wordy and critical. Nervousness or mental imbalance may be present. Your partner may possibly be connected with education, writing, traveling, sales, language interpretation or clerical, secretarial, typing or computer work.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the most positive results from any partnership you should learn to control your argumentativeness and your desire to criticize."},
  {planetno: 3, houseno: 6, title: "Venus in 7th house", body: "You are charming, sociable and friendly and it is easy for people to see your loving nature. Partnerships are generally happy and harmonious. But your desire for peace and harmony at all costs may be detrimental to you if you do not stand up for your own needs. You desire a spouse who is attractive and probably well off financially. Creature comforts and enjoying them with your partner are desired. Take care that you do not get in the habit of expecting too much from others, though.\r\n\r\nYou have a deep appreciation of the value of relationships. Too great an emphasis on affection might cause problems for you. A desire for the perfect relationship may be so strong that any imperfections in your relationship could be blown up beyond proportion. Balance and poise are necessary.\r\n\r\nYou seek a partner that can supply you with \"the good life\". You want beauty, luxury and the finer things in life and you seek a partner who can provide these. Perhaps marriage will bring you to a higher station in life. Over-indulgence and over-emphasizing the sensual side of life can lead to problems. You must have a partner you feel is cooperative rather than competitive. If Venus is aspected poorly in your chart, then perhaps your partner's moral standards are subject to question."},
  {planetno: 4, houseno: 6, title: "Mars in 7th house", body: "You are independent, like to have your own way and you must develop gentleness and diplomacy in order to avoid rubbing people the wrong way. You need to learn how to cooperate with others.\r\n\r\nRelationships energize you and you get a great deal of stimulation from them. You desire an active partner who can help you share in the goings-on of the world. Your partner needs to challenge you, help you initiate projects and perhaps compete with you. You need a sparring partner! Your relationships have much energy and you need to channel that energy into constructive means and not into destructive ones. The competition between you and your partner might better be directed towards the outer world.\r\n\r\nIn all your dealings with others you enjoy the element of challenge and competition. You may goad others just to see how they will react. The chase is important to you, perhaps more important then the end result. Because you enjoy the action, you may not mind losing battles to a partner who is prepared to carry the fight to you. Your marriage partner is likely to be very ardent, positive, active, capable and courageous, with a will of their own.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the partner you seek is someone who can play the role of a champion or a crusader. Mars here makes for an association where the passions have full play and a love match with much devotion is possible. The tendency is to marry early, often as a result of love at first sight, although if Mars is badly aspected, you may \"marry in haste and repent at leisure\".\r\n\r\nThere may be strife and friction in marriage as a result of the partner's hasty temper, intemperance, extravagance, brashness, intolerance, over-demanding attitude or violence.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the best results from marriage and partnership, you should try to be as cooperative and easy-going as possible, practicing gentleness and diplomacy rather than allowing any assertive or quarrelsome tendencies to gain the upper hand."},
  {planetno: 5, houseno: 6, title: "Jupiter in 7th house", body: "Benefit, opportunities and wealth may come about as a result of marriage or partnerships in general. You seek a partner that can expand your visions, open up opportunities for expansion and help you grow. Your partner can strengthen your faith and deepen your religious or philosophical attitudes and ideas. You may feel that you need a partner to help you develop your moral outlook and social conscience.\r\n\r\nYour partner, who may be a member of one of the professions, may be more affluent than you. If Jupiter is badly aspected in your natal chart, then your partner may be somewhat opinionated, lazy, self-indulgent, extravagant and self-willed, sometimes untrustworthy, immoral, shameless and wasteful.\r\n\r\nYou are able to bring out the generous and good-natured impulses of others, but in order to get the best results from the marriage partnership you may need to control any extravagant tendencies and prevent false pride from unduly affecting the smooth course of your relationships.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 6, houseno: 6, title: "Saturn in 7th house", body: "There may be the tendency to attract older, more serious partners. Partnerships may involve much duty, responsibility and hard work. There may be a karmic tie from the past to the partners in this life. Whatever the case, there may be a feeling of restriction, bondage, depression and anxiety in your relationships. They certainly can be enduring, though.\r\n\r\nSaturn here indicates you need to learn to cooperate with and to develop empathy for others. You are perhaps cautious about marriage, but, when committed, may find it very difficult to leave your marriage partner, even if you are unhappy. You may marry for security rather than love. Discipline is needed in relationships.\r\n\r\nThere may be a very self-controlled and sometimes calculating attitude towards all forms of partnership. You are inclined to seek a partner who will awaken your sense of responsibility and give you a greater sense of purpose and will to succeed. For a woman there may be a subconscious desire to marry a \"father figure\" and the partner may well feel an urge to organize your life on a more effective basis.\r\n\r\nThe responsibilities of marriage or the fear of marriage may delay marriage. If Saturn is well aspected in your natal chart, then this position usually indicates that one loyally abides by marriage vows and faithfully carries out marital duties. With a well placed and well aspected natal Saturn, the partner is likely to be a person of integrity, faithful, steady, reliable, industrious, persevering and economical, perhaps not over-demonstrative and preferring deeds to words, and providing a real anchor for the partnership.\r\n\r\nIf natal Saturn is badly aspected, then there is a tendency to endure an unhappy marriage rather than to lose face by breaking up. If you neglect to make your partner happy, your own happiness will be affected in the same proportion. This position can also mean a second choice marriage, which endures in spite of boredom, unhappiness and a lack of love. In other words you may have wanted to marry someone else but settled on a second choice instead. The partner may act in such a way as to become a burden, and may be uncommunicative, narrow in outlook, cold, and over-critical. In some cases the spouse may be much loved, but prone to ill health. Marriage to a widow or widower is possible."},
  {planetno: 7, houseno: 6, title: "Uranus in 7th house", body: "Your partnerships are unique or unusual, usually possessing a wonderful rapport or a total lack of understanding. You and/or your partner are generally unconventional and you do things for their shock appeal. Plenty of freedom is desired in the relationship and there may be a lack of desire for commitment. In fact, maybe you search out special situations in your relationships that ensure little commitment. Perhaps you are most attracted to those who are already in relationships or who are otherwise \"unavailable\".\r\n\r\nBecause of the uniqueness that exists within your partnerships, it is likely that others will not understand them. You may not understand them yourself. You meet the most interesting and unconventional people in your life.\r\n\r\nAny need to control the other person in your relationships will probably lead to disaster. Partner and you will have to find your own comfort level regarding time and attention spent on the other. A lot of elbow room may be required. A relationship in which you feel you are free to grow is one that makes it possible for you to do so. Any limits or constraints placed on the relationship are likely to be met with a certain \"hit the road\" attitude. Sudden and unexpected turns are likely. Perhaps one person is required to be away from the other for long periods of time. This position may give many long distance, \"casual\" types of relationships.\r\n\r\nYou probably seek a partner who provides the thrills and spills for you in your life. A partner who challenges you mentally and emotionally is desired. Your relationships may be lab experiments where you hope to learn who-knows-what. Someone who is inventive, individualistic, creative, original, out-going, eccentric or radical appeals to you. Your partner may possess considerable personal magnetism and occasionally a degree of genius, but eccentricities, erratic tendencies and even fanaticism may be present.\r\n\r\nYour approach to marriage may be highly idealistic or utopian and there may be an inclination to favor platonic unions. You want and need your partner to be your friend. Most of your relationships probably started as friendships. On the other hand, there may be a tendency to seek excitement in partnerships and a marked interest in romantic adventures may result in passing infatuations that can cause a rift with the marriage partner.\r\n\r\nThe greatest threat to marriage may occur when one partner's capacity for self-development expands at a rate greatly in excess of the other's, so that one spouse may no longer be recognizable as the person they were when the marriage took place.\r\n\r\nFor a successful partnership, you and your partner will need to develop the qualities of tolerance, cooperation, detachment and freedom."},
  {planetno: 8, houseno: 6, title: "Neptune in 7th house", body: "There may be a tendency to idealize marriage or the marriage partner. Many sacrifices may be made for the spouse. The marriage partner can be spiritually minded, artistic or just plain confusing. Communication may be a problem due to your concepts and ideals not coinciding. There is the tendency to attract a partner whereby you or they play the role of martyr or savior. The feeling may be that your partner \"needs\" saving and that you're the only one who can \"save\" (change) them. Because of this your partner may be an alcoholic or a drug (ab)user.\r\n\r\nYour imagination and your idealization of your partner may be more real to you than what your partner is in reality. If this is so, then there will come the day when your blinders are removed and you will see their true nature. This then may lead to great disappointment and discouragement when you find out that they or you have been living a lie and that things are not as they have appeared. With this position you must make absolutely sure you are dealing with the hard, cold facts of your relationship and not the romantic notions dreamed up from storybook tales.\r\n\r\nYou are likely to seek a marriage partner who can provide a source of inspiration and bring out your capacity for compassion and loving understanding. There can be a tendency to see a prospective partner through rose-colored glasses or to weave imaginative fantasies about new contacts or hoped-for encounters. Consequently there is a possibility that the partner may not be the type of person conjured up by your imagination.\r\n\r\nThere is some tendency to form partnerships based on admiration or pity. If your natal Neptune is afflicted, such admiration may have resulted from your having been dazzled by glamorous externals, while an over-active sense of pity may be exploited by a prospective partner so that you marry out of sentiment or misplaced sympathy.\r\n\r\nPossibilities exist that the partner is very sensitive and may need to be treated with kid gloves. The partner may be artistic or musically inclined or have some connection with drama or the stage. The material side of life may not concern them. Your relationship may be quite spiritual and above the sordid things of this life, hence it may be more platonic than sexual. The other side of the coin is that you may become involved with unreliable, inconstant and somewhat shiftless types whose sympathies may be largely focused upon themselves, or they may be underprivileged in some way, or neurotic or invalids suffering from chronic ill health.\r\n\r\nAn unconscious willingness on your part to indulge in self-deception regarding your partner is possible. This may keep you in a bad relationship because you refuse to see the truth or you falsely believe that only you can change things.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the best results from the marriage relationship you must learn to overcome vague desires for an unattainable ideal, to control any tendency to get carried away by shallow romanticism and to be as clear-headed and practical as possible when assessing the virtues and attractions of prospective mates. Stay well-grounded."},

A partner such as this could make the relationship very combative and competitive rather than harmonious and equal-sided.\r\n\r\nYou are inclined to seek a partner who will provide a challenge to discover new resources within yourself that will give you the power to transcend previous performances and to transform certain aspects of your being. A partner who makes you feel growth and intensity is one you seek. There is a tendency to admire well developed will power in others, with the result that you may attract those who tend to dominate you, possibly feeling that if you have to cope with a somewhat overpowering personality you may discover more effectively the full extent of your own resources.\r\n\r\nThere are intense feelings and reactions in your relationships.

You are responsive to the feelings of others. Concerning vocation: The network of friendships within the work situation is emphasized.

  {planetno: 8, houseno: 10, title: "Neptune in 11th house", body: "You are idealistic and interested in the common good. Strong hunches regarding your hopes and wishes are present. Because the influence of Neptune is elusive, there may be difficulty deciding upon your goals. Just dreaming about them will not bring them about.

Combat and competitiveness spur you on to greater achievements. Self-reliance is high within you and you probably feel that you are more capable than those around you, hence you may end up doing all the work, which may antagonize you if you feel that others are not holding up their end of things. Saturn's worst quality is selfishness and Aries worst quality is interference with the plans of others. Therefore, you are also capable of meddling and trying to run the affairs of others. You may run roughshod over them in trying to get them to do your will rather than their own. You can be a real slave-driver. You dislike restraint of any kind and do not take kindly to others telling you what to do. Remember this as you give the orders. Obstructions, frustrations, and limitations come into play in your pioneering, self-starting efforts. Freedom comes only through responsibility and discipline. Impatience can ruin all the good work you try to do. Caution may need to be developed in the carrying out of your plans. Stability and security are important to you and you work with those thoughts in mind. Feelings of being inadequate may spur you on to tackle immense undertakings in order to feel more valued or worthy. Stress from trying to accomplish too much may make you prone to headaches. Saturn in Aries calls for you to be self-sacrificing.\r\n"},

Thus your romances may start off in a blaze of excitement and glory only to end in boredom and monotony. There are always fresh fields to conquer and you go after them. It's almost a crusade for you. Venus worst qualities are trying too hard to please others and taking the line of least resistance. In relationships, then, you may choose partners who tend to dominate you and want you to do things their way at the expense of your own wishes. Venus in Aries calls for you to be assertive, yet not dominating, pleasing, yet not a dishrag. You are independent and have an impulsive approach to love. You like competitiveness and perhaps pick fights just for the action and excitement.

Arians have executive and organizing ability which is mainly directed in starting things. Sustaining projects is not their strength, but initiating projects is. The tendency to \"damn the torpedoes\" and ram full-speed ahead must be controlled. Arians are capable of great accomplishments if they learn how to constructively use their abundant energies.\r\n\r\nArians are naturally enthusiastic and are always ready for activity and competition. They are inspiring to others because of these tendencies. Ideas and creative projects seem to flow from them in a never-ending stream. They are full of energy and never lack courage.\r\n\r\nBecause Arians can be pretty self-centered, they must remember that other people may have good ideas and can assume responsibility and leadership roles, too. The natural tendency for an Arian is to stand alone and do everything themself. But cooperation with others can be very effective in getting things done to the end rather than simply starting things and quitting before completion. Arians have a tendency to start a project, then to suddenly lose interest in it if progress is too slow or things have become too complicated.\r\n\r\nArians are very straight-forward and are neither subtle nor devious. They say what's on their mind and they pull no punches. They don't hold grudges and although they can get quite angry, they do not hold it in and stew about what bothers them. They blow in and out like some great Midwestern thunderstorm. It may be violent while it lasts, but it is usually over quickly.\r\n\r\nArians are prone to headaches due to tension. Arians are usually aggressive in relationships and generally take the lead.

You prefer a regular routine, with definite hours and clearly defined responsibilities and tasks. You enjoy building and seeing the results of your hard work.

You enjoy sustaining what others have started, especially if you can see tangible, practical results. You love to build things.

You seek security and often expect this security to come from materials possessions and resources. Hence, you desire to collect material goods and money. You cling to things from the past or things you are used to in order to find this security. A great deal of affection and closeness is needed by you and this helps to assuage feelings of insecurity. But sometimes you hold onto people much too closely so they feel they can't breathe. You expect loyalty in love and you are very devoted to those you care about.

Routine work does not bother them as long as the end result in useful and serves some concrete purpose.\r\n\r\nPossessions and material things are usually of great significance to Taureans. This is because they don't feel emotionally secure unless they can see and touch the objects they own. This intense need to possess and enjoy with the senses can drive Taureans to be extremely productive or extremely acquisitive. Lesser evolved Taureans can treat people as objects or possessions, thus leading to difficulty in relationships.\r\n\r\nTaurus people work at a slower pace than most, but they always finish whatever projects they start. Because of this, they are reliable, trustworthy, careful and steadfast. They are better at sustaining what others have started rather than starting things themselves.

Simply imagine an angry bull and you know what a Taurean is capable of when he is pushed too far. You know the saying about a bull in a china shop, right? When angered, Taureans need plenty of time to cool down. It is best to just leave them alone. You will know when things are out of their system. With anything Taureans need time to assimilate and mull things over.

The feelings that usually accompany this fear of loss are possessiveness, jealousy, laziness, stubbornness and extravagance. If there is no desire to possess anything or anyone, then there is no fear of loss. Taureans need to learn to desire only mental and spiritual things and to release the desire to possess people emotionally and physically. Their other need is to find a true sense of values.

Your mind is sharp and you enjoy mental challenges, games, or competitions. Matching wits with someone else really brings out the competitor in you. Your drive and energy is more mental than physical. You use your wit, intelligence, communication skills, social sophistication, and awareness to achieve your goals.

Debate and argument appeal to you. There is a tendency to scratch the surface with the things that strike your interest without learning anything very deeply. This is the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none position. There is danger, then, of superficiality. Control of thought, word, and action is necessary in order to be successful.

At times they can also be quite contradictory, restless, two-faced, critical, and impatient. Gemini people enjoy and need work that includes a great deal of variety. They love to do several things all at the same time, sometimes making them late for appointments. They abhor boredom.\r\n\r\nGeminians tend to flit from one experience to another, gathering in all types of information along the way, but seldom getting to the depth of any subject. They go broad and not deep. Persistence is not their strong suit. Gaining knowledge and disseminating it is their real talent. Hence, they make wonderful salespeople or teachers if they stick around long enough to get all the facts instead of only half the story. Even if they do not possess all the facts, since they are never at a loss for words, they will continue with their story as if they did have all the facts.\r\n\r\nIt is important for a Geminian to seek intellectual satisfaction. Mental stagnation turns them off, so they read extensively and communicate widely in order to satisfy this longing for mental stimulation. This discontent can make them either very ambitious, or it can incline them to jump from one thing to another, searching for the greener grass which never appears.\r\n\r\nGeminians usually think quickly on their feet and have the ability to use the right words in any situation. They possess tremendous wit and a good sense of humor. Other people may have difficulty in keeping up with their rapid change of subjects.\r\n\r\nBecause Geminians think so quickly, they often finish other people's sentences for them. This can be most frustrating for the person trying to express their own thoughts. There is a need to learn how to control the tongue and allow slower people to express their own opinions and ideas.\r\n\r\nSince Geminians have the capacity to see both sides of any issue, they may fluctuate back and forth between opposing viewpoints. They will usually tend to side with the opinion of whomever they happen to be with at the moment. Then they change as the circumstances change. Indecisiveness is a problem for Geminians.\r\n\r\nGeminians are usually emotionally detached. They use their minds rather than their hearts to find their way through things. Logic and reason are their guidelines. They are able to understand what makes other people behave as they do, but they have difficulty in projecting themselves into the emotional reactions of the person involved.\r\n\r\nSome of the negative traits that Geminians possess are lack of concentration and focus, undependability, fickleness, indecisiveness, superficiality, wishful thinking, and dreaminess. They can also be pretty good at nagging.\r\n\r\nGeminians need to work on getting their mind under control. Their nervous system is highly strung. If they don't learn to control their nerves, they are apt to become ill. The way out of this difficulty is to take the emphasis off themselves and lose it through service to others. Above all, the Geminian needs to learn to channel (control) his energy and his mind.\r\n"},

There is a tendency for improper digestion due to the lack of certain digestive juices in the stomach. It would be best if you did not drink liquids with your meals (except milk, which is a food).

Perhaps this is why you so easily become moody, irritable and inconstant in thought and feeling. Learning to control your own moods may be very difficult, yet necessary, for you. Your greatest need is to nurture and mother someone or ones. You often appear irrational to others because you can't always explain the reason or source of your feelings. Anyone who lives with you must accept your ups and downs and appreciate your need for times of withdrawal. You are also very sympathetic and understand the unspoken feelings and needs of others. You take slights very personally and though you may forgive a mistake by a friend or loved one, you never forget it. Security is very important to you and you look for it in your home and family life. Your senses and emotions are quite strong and it would be wise for you to listen to your intuitive side as you can be quite psychic. You are very tenacious and you do not give up or let go of things or people easily. Your mother is/was a strong influence for good or ill in your life. You are basically an introvert, but will do whatever it takes to protect and defend your family or loved ones. You tend to be a pack-rat because everything has an emotional memory behind it and you find security in all those memories. Nothing or no one is ever gone if they leave their memory behind. Thus, you can become quite possessive. You have the memory of an elephant, but you must learn to forgive and forget past hurts."},

You may have weight problems, especially later in life because you do enjoy the delicacies of the dinner table. Your full potential may not be reached until middle or later life.

They generally do not tackle anything straight away, but always from the flank. Emotionally, they are up one minute and down the next. These mood swings are sometimes difficult for others to understand and deal with.\r\n\r\nCancerians are tenacious, sympathetic, industrious, sociable, thrifty and protective. They can also be argumentative, sensitive, emotional, martyr-like, intuitive, psychic, and patriotic.\r\n\r\nCancerians respond to life through their emotions rather than through their minds. They tend to absorb the emotional vibrations of wherever they're at, so it is important to always be in positive environments. Because they live in their feelings, they unconsciously seek sympathy and attention and affection from others. They have a strong need to feel secure. Home and family bring the highest sense of security. Because of all this, they want to be first with those they love or they are very unhappy. Cancerians must learn to release their loved ones to live their own lives.\r\n\r\nCancerians are well-known for changing  their minds, their moods, anything. Since they usually possess a slower moving life force, they are usually less active than others. In order to be active, they must first motivate their mind. In general, they dislike exercise. As a consequence, they may become out of shape and gain weight in later years.\r\n\r\nCancerians most often have excellent memories. This causes them to reminisce about the past and how things were done then. They are generally pack rats, saving everything, especially if it has some sentimental value. This gives a sense of security.\r\n\r\nCancerians are home loving, fond of family life and domestic tranquillity, enjoyers of travel and adventure, quietly tenacious and hard working for the welfare of the family. No matter how far they may roam, they always want a home to come back to. They may not be in it very much, but they still want a secure home base.\r\n\r\nCancerians are conservative, but unfortunately, they are born worriers. Their tendency to keep all their problems to themselves is the reason some of them suffer from ulcers. They have this sense that something is about ready to sneak up on them and \"get\" them. Watch a Cancer walk and see if they aren't walking a bit sideways, looking ahead of them and behind them at the same time. Stabilizing the emotions is important work for any Cancer person."},

Although appearing strong on the outside, most Leos are inwardly sensitive and their feelings are easily hurt. When this occurs, they can turn on the object of their affection, when their pride is hurt.\r\n\r\nLeos have a decided flair for the dramatic and they enjoy telling stories, being the center of attention, having a good time, and running the show. Mean and cruel acts are generally beneath them, but they do not hesitate to use force when needed. No matter what their actions, they always have the belief that whatever they do is for the other person's benefit.\r\n\r\nIf a Leo is angered, he immediately goes into his kingly role, \"mounting his throne\" and quickly putting the opposition or challenger in their proper place.

You are somewhat timid about expressing too much sentiment or emotion. You may lack confidence in your own attractiveness and ability to draw love to yourself. This could create doubt of your own worthiness to receive love and appreciation. There is a strong tendency to be very critical of the partner and too expect perfection. Marriage may be delayed due to the desire to find that perfect partner, which does not exist. You desire everything to be clean and orderly around you.

Knowledge, ideas, and theories don't really interest you unless they are useful in a practical, tangible way. You love to analyze, measure, and dissect everything, but perhaps you miss hints, nuances, and subtle shades of feeling and meaning. Your strengths are in your precise thinking, careful craftsmanship, and mastery of technical skills.

It may be difficult for you to receive warmth, affection, or appreciation, for you often feel that you don't really deserve it or that \"they don't really mean it\". You can therefore seem rather cool and aloof, much more so than you feel. At times you can be so critical of others that you drive them and their love away.

You tend to be industrious, trustworthy, intuitive, reserved, practical and down-to-earth, especially where emotions are concerned. Intelligence, usefulness and fastidiousness are important themes. You have the ability to analyze people and situations and, then, find the quickest, most efficient method of accomplishing whatever is needed. This may make you an excellent housekeeper, nurse and/or manager. You must, however, watch your tendency to nit-pick or to become overly fussy concerning small details.

On the negative side, though, they can also be aloof, skeptical, picky, sarcastic, depressed, critical, pessimistic, whiny, and self-centered. Virgoans are happy when they can work with a lot of details, usually of a technical or analytical nature, in and for the service of others.

There is an inborn love of order and harmony. They are always subconsciously seeking perfection in whatever they attempt. Because they push themselves so hard to be perfect, they have a tendency to look for perfection in others. If they find it lacking, they can become pretty critical and faultfinding.\r\n\r\nVirgos have a tendency to worry. This is because they desire perfection and are always thinking about how something can be made better or how they can do something better, even, and especially, after the fact. This tension can affect their health, causing intestinal disorders. Virgos need to develop a positive outlook on life, as this has a direct affect on their health. If they become too anxious about life, they can become hypochondriacs. They are generally healthy and are always looking for new ways to take care of themselves, usually through better diet or through natural means of healing. Whether old or young, all Virgoans need a quiet period each day in order to rest their active minds. In any case, many Virgos look much younger than their years.\r\n\r\nIn love, a Virgoan has difficulty expressing himself as passionately as he desires.

Marriage or partnerships may be restricting, requiring hard work and discipline so that you may learn the lessons of cooperation rather than competition. Marriage and partnerships give you a sense of security and for that reason you seek them out. You may marry for practical reasons, for money, or to someone a lot older or younger. Various possibilities exist with this position. You may take great trouble to find a mate who is able to demonstrate a similar integrity, and thus marry at a later age than most, or you may choose an older partner or a contemporary who is apt to be austere or undemonstrative. A desire for perfection may make you too demanding in the marriage or your view of marriage may be too conventional or old-fashioned.

Sometimes this happens so easily that you do not appreciate what you have. Harmony is valued so much that you will compromise a great deal in order to keep it. You do not like to dwell on controversial or emotionally difficult subjects and often try to \"smooth things over\" or \"sweep them under the rug\".

But if Mars is badly aspected, then this can bring opposition and criticism from the public and the opposite sex, fickleness in love relationships, and trouble from toying with the affections of others. Desire for competition and cooperation swing back and forth. You seek a balance between acting independently and assertively and working cooperatively and interdependently with others. You may feel frustrated at times that you cannot simply do what you want to, that you must always accommodate the needs and desires of others. Or you may feel hesitant to act in a positive, assertive manner if you do not have the support and approval of other people. Either way, you are not a loner.

If carried too far, they get to the point where they can't come up with any conclusion, thus they can be very indecisive. They tip the scales one way, then the other, hoping to find the proper balance. Librans have an innate sense of fairness, though, and can be diplomatic, cooperative, helpful, idealistic, sociable, dependent, insincere, lazy and self-indulgent. Librans are happiest when in partnership or in situations where they can adjust or work with human relationships. Pleasant surroundings are important to them.\r\n\r\nBecause Librans enjoy people and human interaction so much, they have a difficult time being alone. Because of this, they need to share their life with someone. Unfortunately, they have a tendency to be \"in love with love\", because of their romantic and sentimental natures. Thus, they could rush into marriage without forethought and end up in a difficult relationship.\r\n\r\nLibrans find it virtually impossible to remain emotionally stable if there is discord around them. This leads to their wanting peace at any price, which allows others to take advantage of them. They want to be liked by everyone, sometimes to their detriment.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, indecisiveness can be one of the hardest problems for Librans to overcome. If they wait too long to make a decision, they may miss many excellent opportunities. Since they have the ability to see both sides of an argument, they generally do not like to choose either one. Since they are able to see the entire issue, if they are asked for help, they can give sound, practical advice. But their attempt to be all things to all people can lead them into hot water. They have difficulty saying \"no\".\r\n\r\nThe other problem Librans find difficult to deal with is the desire to put off work for as long as they can. This gives them a reputation for being lazy. They aren't lazy, of course, if the proper motivation is there.\r\n\r\nIt is many times easy for others to sway a Libran's opinion. A stronger personality can easily dominate a gentler Libran, until the Libran becomes incapable of making a move without consulting the \"expert\". Librans need to learn to think for themselves and stand up for their own beliefs and principles.\r\n\r\nLibrans are quite creative, highly mental, and very sociable. This mental agility is usually not seen by others because of the Libran's easygoing, friendly appearance. Many times this mental agility plays out with them using very subtle techniques to get what they want, which they usually do.\r\n"},

  {planetno: 0, signno: 7, title: "Sun in Scorpio", body: "Two animals are used to represent Scorpio, the eagle and the scorpion. The eagle is capable of reaching great heights because he has mastered his lower nature and overcome his passions and the temptations of the sensual sphere. The eagle has risen above the physical world because he has regenerated himself. The scorpion, however, represents those who have not regenerated their thoughts and actions and are still living degenerate lives. They use their cunning and strike when least expected. These are the ones who satisfy their passions regardless of consequences.\r\n\r\nScorpios in general are ambitious, efficient, courageous, resourceful and intuitive. But, they can also be jealous, sarcastic, resentful, stubborn, possessive and vindictive. Scorpio people enjoy impossible tasks. They like work that demands continued, determined effort and intense concentration. They are born detectives.\r\n\r\nScorpio gives a strong will and determination to accomplish anything undertaken. Scorpios possess an analytical mind, strong intuition, reasoning powers, perception, long range planning ability, magnetism and energy. Scorpios have very definite opinions. These opinions can be so rigid that no amount of persuasion will make them change their minds.\r\n\r\nScorpios make friends easily and give unwaveringly to them. In these relationships, they like to know what your plans are, but, because of their secretiveness, they do not necessarily want you to know what they are planning. They are capable of extreme self-sacrifice for those they love. If any of their loved ones are threatened in any way, they feel that they, too, are being threatened. This causes them to instinctively strike out, either verbally or physically.\r\n\r\nBecause a Scorpio's unconscious mind is more in control than their conscious mind, they lose all sense of judgment under criticism. Under attack, they make effective use of both silence and sarcasm. Unfortunately, their sarcasm can become vindictive. They can, and will, wait a long time in order to get even. Scorpios need to learn forgiveness.\r\n\r\nIt is usually difficult to deceive a Scorpio because their intuition enables them to understand the motives of other people. They receive very strong first impressions of others \\97 experiencing either a liking or a dislike for the person involved.\r\n\r\nScorpios need to learn flexibility, both in thought and action. Once their course of action is set, it is difficult for them to change. Trivial things bore Scorpios and they would rather go deep rather than broad. The more intense, the better. In whatever they do, they want to be completely engrossed. Half-hearted measures are not for them.\r\n\r\nScorpios have the tendency to do things to extremes, either all or nothing. They have to get to the bottom of whatever it is that interests them. They have to know everything, yet they remain mysterious and secretive. Although it may not appear so, there are powerful emotions and desires at work within a Scorpio underneath the surface. This power is one reason for their great endurance. Sometimes in their battles they trample on others in the process. This is why they are sometimes classified as great saints or great sinners.\r\n\r\nScorpios regard themselves as their own judge, jury, and executioner and punish themselves unnecessarily at times. They are self-sufficient, but not necessarily self-assured. They rarely actively seek applause or the limelight. Scorpios are generally healthy, but can be inclined to overindulgence in food, drugs, sex or alcohol.\r\n\r\nIn matters of love, Scorpios are loyal, affectionate and demonstrative, and perhaps possessive and controlling. They are happiest and most fulfilled with one partner with whom they can combine emotional and sexual love.\r\n"},

Simply blurting out their ideas and opinions is due to their never-ending search for truth and wisdom.

Regardless of their undiplomatic remarks, others instinctively feel as if the Sagittarian means them no real harm and is only interested in raising their consciousness.\r\n\r\nSagittarians love the outdoors, large animals, nature and sports. Some have reckless gambling tendencies and will bet it all on the drop of a hat. Travel and even long walks appeal to them because they make the Sagittarian feel free \\97 and he needs to feel free.\r\n\r\nSagittarians are philosophical and they want to understand the deeper issues and abstractions of life. They have a certain faith in higher things that generally always keeps them of an optimistic bent, no matter what difficulties are currently besetting them. They want to understand the meaning of life. This helps to keep them growing and expanding, which is something they need to do.

They have a real gift for making friends and the typical Sagittarian can go anywhere in the world without ever feeling lonely, for they acquire friends along the route. They have humanitarian instincts and are practical in expressing them. They will tend to help anyone who is in need. You can usually depend on their loyalty and honesty, for there is nothing devious or manipulative in their nature.\r\n\r\nSagittarians are extremely independent and restless, with a real need for personal freedom. They can experience claustrophobia, either physical or emotional. This is why they are reluctant to get into total commitment situations and often shy away from marriage. In love, Sagittarians are highly romantic, but they need their partner to be intelligent and communicative. They hate jealousy and possessiveness on the part of their partner, especially since they are fond of flirting. They enjoy the chase more than the capture.\r\n\r\nCareerwise, Sagittarians are reluctant to become tied down to a set schedule, so will experiment with a variety of jobs. They do best in careers that permit them to travel about, either locally or widely. They also like dealing directly with people, either selling or promoting ideas, products, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Sagittarian may overlook small details, but their overall sense of planning is excellent. They have good memories. The challenge of a problem is what interests them, for it caters to their enjoyment in exploring the unknown.

Since they are not particularly concerned as to what other people think of them, they often do not bother forming opinions about other people's behavior.\r\n\r\nIn love, Aquarians want an intellectual companion with whom they can communicate. They can be hesitant about making a total commitment such as marriage, or any other form of partnership, because of their desire for independence. However, when an Aquarian marries, the marriage is usually stable. They are loyal and faithful to their marriage partner, but are not prone to excessive displays of affection, especially in public.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 3, signno: 11, title: "Venus in Pisces", body: "Your affections are expressed in sympathetic, compassionate, softhearted, romantic ways. You unselfishly give of yourself to those you love or to those who need or ask for your help. You may be a sucker for any sort of sob story and perhaps give too much at times which make some overly dependent on you. You are very idealistic in matters of love and this sometimes plays itself out whereby you become the martyr or the savior in relationships. You tend to be more compassionate than passionate and you become involved with others because they need love or need to be \"saved\" and you want to help them rather than out of mutual attraction or pleasure. You attract and are attracted to those who are sensitive, imaginative, or musically or artistically inclined. Your desire is to find someone you can have a deep, spiritual relationship with. You idealize love and have a very beautiful, romantic vision of what love can be. At times you can simply be in love with love. You may be highly emotional, perhaps overly so, sensitive, artistic, compassionate, gentle and psychic. You can be too easy-going or submissive and allow yourself to be taken advantage of because you do not want other people to feel let down and you don't like to make waves. You may have the attitude that somehow you must suffer in love, and do so willingly.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 4, signno: 11, title: "Mars in Pisces", body: "Your energies and aggressions tend to come out in non-combative and noncompetitive ways. You are a bit of a pacifist and do not enjoy tackling anyone or anything head-on in a directly confrontational manner. Working around people or situations or working behind the scenes, in secret, is more your preferred style. If necessary, it is more your tendency to give up something rather than to fight for it. Because your ego is not especially interested in personal achievement, glorification, material advantage, or winning at the expense of someone else, you may come across to others as weak-willed or ineffectual. Being on top, being the best, or being first doesn't mean much to you, hence you can be quite happy in a supporting role, working for the benefit of others or for a cause that you believe in. You may experience difficulties in planning clear and definite goals for yourself in the real world. You are not sure what you want out of life, except you instinctively seem to know that you do have and need to find a spiritual purpose. You have many dreams, high ideals, and a strong mystical or religious impulse. You also have a creative imagination and can successfully apply yourself to art or music. You are intuitive, humorous and diplomatic, quiet on the outside, but restless within. On the negative side you can be indecisive, procrastinating, too interested in the sensual side of life, and may resort to using drugs or alcohol as a way to escape the pressures and responsibilities of dealing with everyday life. Learning self-control is important for you. Take action, don't day-dream.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 5, signno: 11, title: "Jupiter in Pisces", body: "Your needs for growth and expansion are perhaps best satisfied when you are working to help raise mankind to a higher spiritual level. You recognize that we are all in this together and what is bad for one is bad for all. You are sympathetic, charitable, genial, unassuming, quiet, visionary, intuitive, with a subtle sense of humor. You have an interest in spiritual or metaphysical ideas and issues, but you need to find your own path and experience Truth for yourself. Periodically retreating from society and the people closest to you is good for your nerves and your own mental health. The strong desire you have to help others comes out in your willingness to help the unfortunate. Perhaps you volunteer in hospitals, jails, or other places of confinement. You give hope to those who need it most. You probably love nature and large animals, especially horses. There may be an interest in healing. On the negative side you may be hypersensitive, over-emotional, too sentimental, have a tendency to exaggerate, or to be too extravagant or self-indulgent.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 6, signno: 11, title: "Saturn in Pisces", body: "It may be difficult for you to set boundaries for yourself and others, or to be as disciplined and organized as you want or need to be. Things have a way of getting lost in the shuffle of everyday life and it may be hard for you to keep your touch on the pulse of things around you. Sometimes you just get lost in the fog and can't see your way clearly. You are intuitive, sympathetic, sensitive, imaginative and self-sacrificing. You are a practical idealist and have a tendency to take life perhaps too seriously. You may have the sense that your present life's troubles are due to actions from the past. And this is probably the truth. You must reap what you have sown in previous lives and Saturn comes to exact his payment. Perhaps this is why you tend to feel more sorrow, perhaps, than the usual person. There can be success in working behind the scenes, away from the public eye, perhaps doing research or working in institutions. On the negative side you can be indecisive and moody, with a tendency to react emotionally to negative conditions or people. Depression can set in if success escapes you or if you feel that you have been unfairly treated. You need to develop faith in the future and let go of the past. Disidentifying from other people's troubles will allow you to help them in their own sorrows. Teaching what you have learned in your experiences is a fine road to soul growth.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 2, signno: 11, title: "Mercury in Pisces", body: "You, your thoughts, and your ways of communicating tend to be idealistic, psychic, intuitive, imaginative, sympathetic, diplomatic, extremely sensitive, compassionate, and visionary. On the negative side you can be lazy, impractical, day-dreamy, over-sensitive, procrastinating, indifferent and absent-minded. You may lack a strong desire to work or to push yourself into doing anything that takes a lot of strength, organization, patience, and responsibility. You would rather be a poet or musician than a scientist or a mechanic. Formal book learning may not be your area of strength, yet you can absorb knowledge in the most remarkable ways if you are interested in the subject area. You are sensitive to your environment and thus you should be careful of which environments you hang around in. Your nerves and your mental health require you to periodically rest away from the noise of the work-a-day world. Take some time to be alone with yourself to regroup. But not too much time, as you have a tendency to get carried away with yourself and your problems. Healing using visualization techniques or healing through the laying on of hands may appeal to you. You may have great interest and talent in art, music, drama or poetry. Your imagination can be quite highly developed. Because you tend to think in terms of mental abstractions, translating your thoughts and impressions into concrete, everyday language may be difficult for you at times and consequently you may appear less intelligent or at least less quick-witted and verbal than others. You dislike being pinned down to facts and you follow your instinct rather than logic. You are intuitive and able to sense what others' thoughts and feelings are, even before they say anything to you. Sometimes you get so immersed in your own world of thought and imagination that you overlook things in your immediate, tangible environment. You are extremely open-minded and believe that anything is possible. Intangible or spiritual forces seem just as real to you as anything in the concrete world and you often form an opinion about a person or situation without much factual knowledge of them, and your impressions are usually correct. Keeping your mind positively occupied is important, as day-dreaming tends to go off in strange directions.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 1, signno: 11, title: "Moon in Pisces", body: "Your emotions are expressed sympathetically and compassionately. You are sensitive, kind and gentle, imaginative, shy, tender-hearted, and have an innate understanding of how other people feel and react to situations. It hurts you if another is hurt. Because of your kindness and non-judgmental attitude, people in trouble, pain or confusion come to you hoping to find answers. It is difficult for them to think that you may be in pain yourself, but even if you are, you will do your best to help them or teach them. You seem to sense that all the pain you have suffered is for a higher purpose, if only to teach others or help show them the way. At times, though, your soft-hearted is taken advantage of and then you feel the need to withdraw, to regain your strength and composure. Music plays an important part in your life and you are instinctively drawn to it. It is as a voice from your spirit's true home. It helps you to express the emotions within that sometimes are so nebulous or vague that they cannot be put into word. You have a very romantic nature and can fall in love with love. Sometimes your feelings and fantasies get so carried away that you become overly emotional or sentimental, much to the dismay of those around you. You have your moody spells that people do not know how to deal with. You are not afraid of difficult or hard work and you especially like to work for those less fortunate than yourself. You prefer to work behind the scenes, as you may be easily drained of energy by others. There may be talent in art, dancing or music. Tendencies to day-dreaming may need to be controlled.\r\n"},
  {planetno: 0, signno: 11, title: "Sun in Pisces", body: "Pisceans are sympathetic, compassionate, unassuming, idealistic, intuitive, congenial, adaptable, psychic, emotional, creative, secretive, versatile, imaginative and self-sacrificing. They can also be impressionable, indecisive, self-pitying, hypersensitive and changeable. They need to serve others.\r\n\r\nPisceans are sentimental and romantic in love. At times they expect too much from others and then feel hurt if the other person doesn't come through for them. They have a strong tendency to place their loved one on a pedestal. This leads to disillusionment when they discover their loved one has faults, too.\r\n\r\nThe symbol for Pisces is two fish going in opposite directions connected by a cord. One fish represents the personality and the other represents the spirit. These two opposing forces operate within a Piscean, causing insecurity and indecisiveness. Handling these forces in a positive manner is very difficult for them. Some will seek to escape these pressures through eating, alcohol, drugs or other excesses. That is what one of the fish represents. The other fish represents the Piscean rising to great heights through self-denial, sacrifice and then ultimate attainment. Pisceans learn through suffering and they need to learn perseverance.\r\n\r\nPisceans tend to absorb the information and environment around them. Thus it is important that they surround themselves with uplifting people and circumstances. Pisceans are creative, self-sufficient people whose minds are extremely active, due to their strong imagination, which they can sometimes get carried away with. They sense and feel things that others are not aware of.\r\n\r\nPisceans generally do not possess strong willpower nor do they have a dynamic approach to life. Although they can appear to be very determined on the outside, underneath, inner doubts are brewing. This insecurity causes them to need reassurance from others. One of their greatest needs is to learn to understand their emotional ups and downs. Since they have a tendency to doubt their own conclusions, they need to learn to believe in themselves.\r\n\r\nPisceans are very generous with their time in helping other people. They always feel their best when they are serving others in some capacity. By using their compassion outwardly for others, they will not become as moody and introverted. Service to others is the safest, shortest road to God.\r\n\r\nSince Pisceans are reluctant to hurt others or to face any sort of confrontation, they can become involved in very difficult emotional situations which they find extremely difficult to break. They have a difficult time saying no sometimes and will stay in bad situations thinking that they can somehow change the other person and then all will be well. Some Pisceans love to play the martyr, while others need to play the savior. Pisceans tend to think with their heart rather than their head and can be easily used by others. Many fall for any kind of sob story, much to their own detriment. Their hearts are in the right place, it's just they need to be more realistic and down-to-earth.\r\n\r\nPisceans can be highly secretive, but they make friends rather easily and are quite loyal to them. They do not particularly like verbal or combative fights, but will defend their friends in subtle ways.\r\n\r\nPisceans sometimes lack vitality which often gives people the idea that they are lazy. Well, some are and Pisceans in general do like to procrastinate. A Piscean needs sufficient time each day to be alone while they regain their fluctuating energies.\r\n\r\nA Piscean's innate desire to escape from physical living can be used constructively through creativity. Many forms of art, dance and music appeal to them. They instinctively seem to know their own capabilities and limitations. Unfortunately, though, their knowledge of their limitations can create an inferiority complex. Pisceans enjoy drama and acting because it gives them the opportunity of being someone else. This enables them to temporarily lose their inferiority complex. Because of their hypersensitivity, they can become instantly depressed over little things that are said to them.\r\n\r\nPisceans can appear to be deceitful because of an inborn need to justify their words and actions. If in trouble, they may attempt to rationalize their way out rather than face the consequences of their behavior.\r\n"}

You have a general dislike for restraint of any kind, don't like to be told what to do, need to learn diplomacy and tact, need to look before leaping, need to better learn how to channel your energies for more constructive purposes and results. Like the ram who symbolizes this sign, you tend to butt your head against your problems hoping that with enough force you can eventually knock down whatever stands before you, including people. You like the challenges of life and are very competitive and sometimes combative. You get bored easily with routine and one thing you may need to practice more of is persistence. You tend to jump from one thing to another, always looking for something new. Finish what you start before moving on. Spiritual lesson to learn: Patience.

Taureans can be led or coaxed, but never pushed or driven. Resources and possessions, whether people or finances are very important to you. You want to build and make things grow, but you can't be hurried. You want to get your hands on things and see the practical results of your own hard work. You are good at taking what others have started then carrying on. Success comes to you by sheer persistence and will. Your love of sweet or rich food can incline you to put on weight.

There may be two distinct sides to you as Gemini represents the Twins. You have a strong need to communicate what you already know and to learn more. You enjoy reading and traveling as they both give plenty of scope for picking up new knowledge. You need variety and can be the jack of all trades and the master of none. You tend to go wide - for breadth, not depth. You may appear confident, but you can lack self-confidence and inner sureness. You love to talk, both with your mouth as well as your hands.

Just like the crab Cancer represents, you may have the habit of looking ahead and behind you at the same time, not fully wanting to face the future head-on and always worrying about the past and what might be sneaking up on you from behind, causing you great worry. You go through life in a curious sideways motion, never going simply directly forward. You are sensitive and you retreat into your shell when you feel threatened. Your feelings can be easily hurt, even when no slight was meant and you can take things much too personally. You enjoy travel, but you absolutely need to know that you have a home base waiting for you to come back to. Security is everything for you in life. Physical security comes with a comfortable base of operations and emotional security comes from all your possessions and attachments that have sentimental value to you. In fact, that's why you keep everything - because of all the emotional value and significance. Once you have latched onto something or someone, you do not tend to let go easily.

The worst thing someone can do to you is to hurt your pride or be unappreciative of you. You wear your heart on your sleeve in matters of love and you need a partner you can be proud of - and you want them to be proud of you. You are faithful to and protective of those you love. You can be quick-tempered, but you tend to not stay angry for long. You like to play the kingly role and have a sense of drama surrounding you. You are a ham. You like being the center of attention and will do things just to get that attention. You can be stubborn in a sunny sort of way. Your roar is worse than your bite. If your pride is hurt or your dignity is trampled on, then watch out, because you can forgive, but you don't forget. You enjoy sports and out-of-doors activity.

You strive for perfection and can be quite the person to live with or to be around because your standards for yourself and others are so high. At times others can never be \"good\" enough to meet those high standards. Finding fault with what's wrong with things is your forte. Sometimes, though, this can make relationships sour as you often turn your critical eye on the one you love and the things they do. Pessimism and being too self-critical are two faults you should try to improve upon. You may tend to worry too much, especially about the small stuff, the little details. Too much worry can lead to health problems. You need to learn to digest every experience and assimilate it without bitterness, regret, spite or resentment.

It represents the battleground where the higher and lower selves must come to mortal combat. They must be aligned and the lower self eventually must die and give way to and obey the higher self, the God within. Physical, emotional, mental and spiritual levels are all involved. You appear calm on the surface, but you can be extremely emotional inside. \"Still waters run deep\", as they say. You tend to be the silent type, always wanting to know others' motivations, but never disclosing your own. You love to play the detective or the ferret. You have to know everything, all the how's and why's. You have great determination and strength, enough to overcome any adversary, even yourself. You need to overcome resentment, possessiveness and jealousy. There may be a fascination, preoccupation, interest and/or ability with the occult, death, sex or healing.

You can shoot for the stars or wallow with the animals. There is love of animals, the outdoors, sports, gambling, adventure, and travel. You may lack concentration. You probably have many acquaintances, but few friends. You tend to have casual contacts rather than in-depth relationships. You have a great restlessness and a love to be on the move. You may always be looking for greener pastures, never stopping or slowing down to see where you really are and what's around you. You tend to be talkative and direct and to the point. You may be lacking in tact and diplomacy due to your frankness. Ideas are very important to you. You generally like working with the big picture and dislike all the little details.

You overcome these feelings through sheer necessity, for you have determination in achieving your goals and purposes in life. You have great ambition and do not settle until you have reached the great heights that you have set for yourself. Money, position and power are important to you. The reserve that often appears as part of your makeup is sometimes taken as coldness. To you it seems that you are being responsible and simply doing your duty. You may have had trouble with your knees. Any trouble with the knees is the outer evidence of an inner inability to be flexible. Spiritual lesson to learn: Sociability (lighten up).

You are here to learn altruism, brotherhood, and working for the common good, to forget yourself and your needs for the sake of your friends, who can also be strangers. You have new and different ways of looking at things. You can be very original and inventive, perhaps eccentric or bohemian. You are prone to uncertain and sudden impulses. You tend to be very intuitive, possessing a good mind. You have organizing ability and are capable and practical. You are intelligent, but sometimes cold and calculating where feelings are concerned. There is a certain detachment about you. You cannot stand possessiveness and jealousy and you require plenty of freedom. Depending on the relative strengths of Saturn and Uranus in your chart, caution, coldness and selfishness may be exhibited (Saturn stronger) or there will be more altruism, freedom and free-flowingness (Uranus stronger). If Uranus is stronger, then the things of the spirit will be stronger than materialistic worldliness. Spiritual lesson to learn: Warmth (less head and more heart).

At times you are too absent from focused awareness of the present. You may dream through life rather than live it. There may be involvement in music or dance or drugs. You may have a lonesomeness that nothing in the outer world can remedy. Being alone at times is an absolute necessity for you. The vibrations of this earth plane may be difficult at times for your sensitive body and spirit to withstand. You are very sensitive to the conditions of your surroundings and can be like a psychic sponge, absorbing all that is around you, for good or ill. You are very likeable, but you need to learn how to be more practical and down-to-earth and how to concentrate your energies on the here and now. You must serve others in this life, but must learn not to be taken advantage of or fall for everyone's sob story. Spiritual lesson to learn: Perseverance.

It is perhaps difficult for you to relax as there is always something that still needs to be done. There may be periodic bouts of depression, anxiety, fear or self-doubt.

You no doubt like to have a lot of projects going on at the same time as you always seem to have much nervous energy. You enjoy being around unusual people and your relationships have probably involved a fair number of these sorts of folks.

Nothing comes for free. Don't let the desire to serve others make you careless when it comes to choosing whom to place your trust in. Don't be a sucker for every sob story you hear.

People see you as magnetic, very forceful and perhaps, at times, just plain downright threatening. They aren't always sure whether the power they sense will be used to help them or harm them. Since Pluto is the planet of power and great force, you may find yourself in situations that require or force you to use strength and will. Others may try to use these qualities against you, so it would be best to remember that \"those who live by the sword shall die by the sword\". In addition you may spend a lot of time trying to eradicate or regenerate some negative character trait within you. You may possess the ability to intuitively know or understand people's thoughts, feelings or motivations. You have natural detective ability."},

You have an inquisitive mind and you try to be diplomatic in your relationships with others. You have leadership qualities which could be developed if you put your mind and will to it. You can be quite emotional at times and this helps to keep you from blowing apart from all the powerful energies wrapped up inside you. Intensity is something you are quite comfortable with. Philosophy and reforming society's ills appeal to you."},

People see you as a threat to their functioning, perhaps even their survival. They will test and try you and you will do the same with them. You do not turn away from competition and sometimes go out of your way to get in a good fight, verbally or otherwise. You perhaps need to learn cooperation. You enjoy relationships that are intense, the more so the better. There is also a tendency to keep your feelings secret from those you become involved with.

You have grand plans and ideas about everything and you believe that you are just the right person to head things up. You have the desire to succeed in life in a big way. You expect the best and usually get it, either through the thoughtful acts of others or because of your own hard work. This aspect brings much good luck, financial reward, enthusiasm and self-pride. The only real danger here is that you may tend to be somewhat over-indulgent, wasteful or extravagant. There is also danger of false pride and a rather inflated ego, though not in a mean sense. You are perhaps a bit of a spend-thrift, not much concerning yourself as to whether or not you should stick to some sort of budget. There is a yearning to know your true inner self and discover what the plan is for your life. You love travel and will probably have the opportunity to do so, perhaps because of your career. This is the aspect of the guardian angel. No matter how close the calls, you are somehow saved, if need be, in the very last moment. Spiritual forces watch over you and protect you from harm.

You have a strong physical drive which expresses itself through passion and sexuality or through creative enterprises. You have a fighting spirit and a desire to compete with anyone, over anything. Your magnetic personality draws people to you. There is danger here of trying to do so much that you eventually burn yourself out. Take some time to rest along the way and you will find that you actually have accomplished more by taking periodic breaks. You are driven by your desire to create, whether in business or in your personal life. You have a victorious spirit and the will to win, whatever the odds. There is impulse, high energy, speed and intensity. But all that energy needs control, discipline and the proper channeling for it to be a constructive force. This is what you must learn to do. Use your willpower to direct the energies into constructive channels. You tend to be argumentative and combative. Physical exercise is important to you so that you can work off some of the stress that having all this energy generates. This aspect favors situations where strength and muscular exertion are needed. Along with all this you have the tendency to be selfish and to only think of your own needs. Your self-interests are much more important than anyone else's. Try to be a little more mindful of the needs of others before your own. With such powerful energies at work, you may have difficulty being humble and modest. Don't let your ego rage out of control.

You enjoy a clear mind, with a quick wit, and you have a love for learning and involving yourself in new experiences. You need constant mental stimulation and activity or you get bored. You have the ability to communicate your ideas to others and to win them over to your viewpoint, but you must watch a tendency to tune out what other people are saying. This happens because your mind is busily thinking about what you are going to say next and you pay no attention to them. You are rather high-strung and you may have the habit of biting your nails, cracking your knuckles or some other fidgety habit.

It is hard for you to put yourself in other people's situations and understand just what things are like for them. You try, but you just don't have that ability. You tend to be impulsive. You need to learn to use your willpower to control the fluctuating emotional turmoils that stir within you. You can be extremely sensitive at times and you do not always take into consideration how your actions will affect other people. You are not unkind, just oblivious. Your vitality and constitution are generally strengthened with this aspect. In any case, though, there is the need for occasional rest to allow your system to recharge and recuperate. The vitality of the Sun can burn up the constitution of the Moon. You are apt to work on many projects all at the same time and it would be good if you could learn to develop more persistence.

The power of suggestion works more easily with you, because of this aspect, than it does for others. There may be strange and mysterious things that happen to you that seemingly defy the rational mind. You have a lot of dreams, visions and yearnings, but may not possess the concentrated will and stamina to do anything with them or to bring them into reality. You are gentle, helpful, sympathetic and compassionate toward others, but you can be taken advantage of by someone with a good sob story. You like to help people in need, but you need to be discriminating about it. You have a need to express yourself creatively, most likely through the arts or through music. You do not like the harsher side of life and you try to avoid facing difficulties whenever you can. This tendency to hide may lead to turning to drugs or alcohol if you do not exercise the appropriate amount of self-control. Running away will not help solve any troubles you have. You are prone to procrastination. There are times when you can be completely self-deluded over what is going on around you. You may experience delusions of grandeur because there are moments when you cannot separate truth from fiction or reality from fantasy. You are emotional, sentimental, romantic and psychically attuned. Avoid any negative psychic practices such as Ouija boards, s\xE9ances, hypnotism and mediums.

You feel driven by some deep, inner sense of destiny and there is an almost compulsive desire for personal recognition. You have a total preoccupation with power and will try to get it at almost any cost. You want to be the world's best at something and that idea spurs you on to all your efforts. You have a powerful magnetism and charisma and people around you either love you and are almost mesmerized by you or they hate you because they feel very threatened by your presence. You will perhaps make a lot of enemies on your climb to the top, just remember that you will reap what you sow, so sow carefully and wisely.

You are fearful of failure and that is why you work so hard so as to avoid it. Depression is a common occurrence for you, but you take it and everything else in stride. You feel alone, that you have to do everything yourself if you want the job done right. But, independence suits you and you do not lash out at your lot in life. It could be a lot worse, you figure. You are ambitious and conscientious to a fault. Your rise in life to a position of authority is a rather slow process, but you work steadily toward it because you are patient and persistent. You tend to be rather stern and judgmental, especially with yourself. Cautious and careful, it is difficult for you to really let go, to be spontaneous and playful. You like to be in control of yourself and you are uncomfortable showing your emotions or your affections. You are shy and self-restrained. To you, life is a serious business.

Seek your Higher Self and you can then turn a lot of these negatives into positives.

You can't seem to make up your mind on anything. You try to do the right thing, but you aren't sure what the right thing is. You have problems with satisfying both your need to be an individual and your need for caring relationships and a sense of belonging. Because of the mixed messages you send out, people don't always know how to respond to you or know what you really want. This can cause confusion and conflict in relationships. You need to find the right balance between your emotions and your will. Come to an awareness that your energy flow fluctuates like the ebb and flow of the tides. When your energy is at a high, you should try to accomplish as much as possible during that time.

You have a need to express yourself creatively through some sort of art form or music, drama or photography, but you may lack the necessary drive, energy, ambition and desire to follow through on your plans. You are attracted to the metaphysical and the occult but there is danger waiting for you if you get involved with negative psychic practices such as Ouija boards, s\xE9ances, hypnotism or mediums.\r\n\r\nYou lack willpower and you too easily succumb to temptation. Drugs or alcohol may tempt you and seemingly offer you a way out of your troubles, but if you give in, they will cause you nothing but sorrow. You suffer from delusions of grandeur and you are not very practical. You need to get your head out of the clouds and come back to reality. You are very sympathetic and compassionate and will go out of your way to help someone. But you lack discrimination and are a sucker for any kind of sob story, hence you are often taken advantage of by others. This leaves you depressed and disillusioned. You must remember, though, that no one can hurt you, use you or take advantage of you unless you allow it. You need to develop more backbone and learn how to say \"NO\".\r\n\r\nYou may experience personal loss of focus and not know what you should be doing with your life. You are overly emotional, romantic or sentimental. Materialism may blind you to spiritual realities. You are extremely sensitive and need to watch which situations and people you surround yourself with. You have a heightened sensitivity to medicine also, so you need to watch your dosages of any prescribed drugs.\r\n\r\nBecause you are gentle and peace-loving, you may lack the will and competitive spirit needed to make your way in the world. Your fantasy life brings self-deception or deception by others. You need to become aware that you may have to stand up for your spiritual convictions and principles, even though it may involve conflict. You are easily hurt by what others say about you and many times you take the easy way out by being non-controversial. You need to learn not to idealize others, but to accept them and appreciate them as they are and not as you wish them to be.

You tend to worship \"heroes\" who have powerful magnetism and charisma, and you want to follow in their footsteps. You need to recognize that your strong will and stubbornness create difficulties for you because you are not allowing others to teach you the lessons you need to learn. In order for you to see this more clearly other people are brought into your life to mirror your negative traits back to you.

You prefer the patterns and activities that you are already used to rather than new experiences. You struggle with feelings of personal inadequacy, inhibitions, self-doubt and loneliness. Everything you try to accomplish has to be worked at very hard and perhaps for a very long time. You are subject to delays and frustrations at every turn, it seems. You may have difficulties with your father or those in authority. This is not an easy aspect, but it does give great persistence, endurance, patience and staying power. You need to learn how to give yourself to others with no thought of reward for yourself. Share your love and possessions and open yourself up to the needs and concerns of others.

You are being asked to compromise and cooperate with others in order to remove any tendency towards self-interest.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge for you is to overcome your self-criticalness. You have a very high standard of what constitutes achievement and perfection and you expect yourself and others to live up to it. But you go overboard with your attitude. First, it is unrealistic. Second, it is impossible to reach. This causes you a great deal of stress and frustration.

There is much jealousy and possessiveness and each of you tries to control the other in as many different ways as possible. You are manipulative and not just in subtle ways. You resort to guilt, innuendo and outright false accusations in order to keep your hold on others. Your feelings can be so compelling at times that you do things that are not at all rational. You undergo periodic upheaval where you must break all ties to people and things and begin everything new from the start. You are likely to be very set in your ways, opinionated and inflexible.

You do not trust yourself and your own capabilities, talents or skills. You believe that you don't have what it takes in order for people to like you. You have low self-esteem and low self-confidence. That is one reason why you are so busy working, trying to prove yourself to everyone. You are filled with insecurities and the fear of failure. You are afraid that what you have, as little as it might be, will be taken away from you. You are lonely and have a difficult time opening up and feeling close to others. You think that you can buy other people's affections and trust. That is not the way it works - you must earn it. You must also realize that others cannot love you until you first come to love yourself, then others after that. You need constant reassurance from others that you are loved, so much so that it may eventually become a burden on your loved ones. There is a strong need for you to re-evaluate the meaning of emotional security. You often feel that you must do something or be something other than what you really are in order to receive approval and acceptance from others. You are very sensitive to criticism and easily feel left out or neglected, and though you may appear cool or distant, you actually care very much about being included in things. Because you are so sensitive, it may seem easier for you to withdraw into a shell rather than risk the emotional bumps and bruises that can occur when you let others really know you in an intimate and personal way.\r\n\r\nYour reserve and caution make establishing a close emotional rapport with others difficult for you. You can gain inner security and emotional strength through periods of solitude if you look at these periods as times where you can nourish yourself and develop your own interests, rather than as times of loneliness. You are subject to occasional bouts of depression, anxiety and frustration. There are delays and roadblocks set up in your path of accomplishment. At times it seems like the whole world is against you and that you have to carry the weight of the world entirely on your own shoulders. You need to learn to overcome your feelings of being totally alone in life. This isn't exactly true. These feelings stem from your inability to express your emotions, so that you feel separated from others. In previous lives, you have tried to love and to be affectionate, but you have been rejected and in this life you are afraid to love because you feel you may be rejected again. You need to learn that emotional security is based on a good philosophy of life and not on other people. Even though you are a controlled, serious and practical person, locked within you is a warm and affectionate person just waiting to get out. But that does involve taking the risk of being hurt again. There's no way around it. You learn through experience.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the single most powerful aspect you can have in a horoscope. Your greatest asset is your ability to learn by experience, for even though you have made many mistakes, your self-knowledge is your salvation. At the height of depression, despair or error you are able to look yourself squarely in the face and start building your way back to where you want to be. You have a jump on the others who are not assisted by the mental energy and psychological drive that this aspect gives.\r\n"},

There are times when you just plain talk too much or say the same things over and over, figuring maybe you weren't understood or heard the first time you said them. You have the tendency to check and re-check things over and over even though you know they were fine the first time, like setting the alarm clock or checking to see if you locked the front door. At times you can be impractical because of the scale of your visions. Travel is especially interesting to you as it gives you a chance to be exposed to and soak up new knowledge. You are always ready to let other people know what your opinions and viewpoints are, even though they haven't asked. Philosophical speculation and theorizing about abstract concepts are fun for you. You're always ready to play Devil's advocate even if you happen to agree with your opponent's point of view. You just like a good discussion, \r\nargument or debate. You enjoy mental sparring matches.\r\nYou are interested in the broad view, in universal principles and systems, in seeing connecting relationships and patterns, and in seeing the whole picture rather than the component parts. You have great respect and thirst for knowledge and education is very important to you, whether it is the formal kind or the informal kind that continues long past college days.

You are attracted to the arts and have creative talent and ability with painting, poetry and especially music. If you do not play a stringed instrument, then at least you are attracted to the sounds they make. Their music is like hearing a voice from your true home in the spirit worlds. Because of your sensitiveness, you are sometimes easily led without your knowledge as the power of suggestion has great effect on you. Important character changes are difficult for you to make as things are not seen clearly. There is danger through drugs and alcohol and you would be wise to stay away from them. You may not have as large a backbone as others and for this reason it is important that you watch what sorts of influences and environments you surround yourself with. You are not the steadiest of people. Stay away from all negative psychic influences such as Ouija boards, s\xE9ances, hypnotism and mediums. Your mind does not function in a linear, logical manner and you are often unable to express your thoughts in simple, everyday language. Symbols, images, art, or music better express your ideas. For this reason you may not do as well in formal book-learning situations as in simply having someone tell you or show you something firsthand. Flights of imagination and fantasy carry you into strange and beautiful worlds and you could develop the ability to write down some of your perceptions to share with others, for example, by writing fantasy, fiction, lyrics, or poetry. You are sensitive to nuances and innuendo, but may become confused between imagination and true perception. You may have difficulty concentrating your attention on practical or mundane activities or in separating truth from fiction. You are attracted to the metaphysical and the mystical.

You have a sense of humor that is more satirical or sarcastic than it is outrightly funny. You are good with your hands and may be ambidextrous. You are very vocal and adamant in expressing yourself and your hands frequently help you convey your message. You are a leader, an executive, a salesperson, a promoter. Others tend to listen to you and follow your lead and you have a talent for directing people and making decisions. You have an aptitude for writing, especially criticism. You aren't afraid to tell people when they are wrong. You may suffer at times from a lack of tact and hoof-in-mouth syndrome is familiar to you.

You are self-assured and decisive in whatever you do. You have a lot of restless and nervous energy and you like staying busy. You get bored fairly easily and that's why you like working on several projects all at the same time. It is hard for you to sit still for very long because of the abundance of energy you have.

New ideas and concepts are important to you and you encourage everyone you come into contact with to experiment and try new things. You are intuitive and many insights come from your Higher Self. You like an unstructured environment free from rules and regulations where you can respond to the needs of the moment. Routine, repetitive work makes you nuts. Your mind functions in an intuitive, nonlinear fashion and sudden insights and flashes of inspiration often come to you \"out of the blue\". You hate being told what to do and how to do it.

You exaggerate the telling of any story for greater effect. You may have little or no faith in a higher power because you can't make sense of the whole issue. You love working with the big picture and want someone else to do the detailed work. You have a penchant for checking and re-checking things multiple times, just to be sure you did something in the first place, like checking to see if you really set the alarm or if you really locked the front door. You tend to do more rather than less. For example, if a recipe calls for a tablespoon, you may add a tablespoon and a half. You figure if this much is fine, then a little more makes things better. You may be intolerant of other people's beliefs, habits or cultures. You tend to gloss over details that come back to haunt you later and you have the propensity to overestimate the potential of an idea or product. You are not intentionally mean-spirited, it's just that you get carried away with yourself and this can be detrimental at times. You have an abundance of ideas, interests, and plans for the future, but you may find it difficult to focus on any particular area. You may devote yourself and your energies to some irrational cause. Philosophy, religion, or other areas of theoretical speculation interest you.\r\n\r\nYou also possess foresight, numerous enterprising ideas, and a gambling instinct, all of which contribute to your success in the world of business. You love to travel, especially if there is some mind-expanding or educational aspect involved with it. There is a love of communicating your thoughts and ideas to others and you may very well be an excellent teacher, formal or otherwise. You need to learn how to discipline yourself so that you think problems through logically, clearly and with full knowledge of the facts. You have a tendency to rush through your thoughts or to be sloppy in your thinking, and perhaps even in your penmanship. Your thoughts go too far, you can get carried away with them, making grandiose plans that are too expansive to be put into concrete reality. Yet, you do seem to be extremely uncritical of others and accept them just as you find them. At times you are absent-minded, even though your mind is very original and fertile. You may have literary or speaking talent. Guard against jumping to conclusions, bad judgment and over-optimism. You have a knack for putting together unrelated ideas and concepts and making something out of them. At times others will take advantage of you because of your sympathetic nature and generosity. You may have the tendency, also, of talking too much, using more words to say something than what it really requires or repeating several times what you have already just said."},

Your mind is alert, quick and always ready for an argument. Your speech is sometimes too hasty and you lack tact. Your tongue is a sword you use to lash out at other people when they have upset you or done something you did not like. You have a temper that can explode into swearing, name-calling and general ranting and raving. You are a convincing and forceful speaker and you have a way of bringing people over to your way of thinking, but you are not especially receptive to the ideas and opinions of others. You need to better learn how to rationally and logically control your desires. Your mental energy should be directed into creative channels instead of wasted in conflicts with others. You are irritable and fault-finding at times and this turns friends and family against you. You are argumentative and rather critical and aggressive in discussions and you like turning any conversation into a debate or verbal war. Try to choose an occupation where this talent is a plus and not a minus. Perhaps you could be a spokesman for a righteous cause, a lawyer vigorously defending a client, an analyst or critic. You love to read and you may have literary talent.\r\n\r\nYou are high-strung and have a lot of nervous energy, thus you find it hard to sit still for very long. You love working on several projects at the same time because it keeps you from getting bored, but you may have difficulty finishing the things you have started. You need to take time out occasionally and give your mind a break so that it does not become overstrained. Inner tension and hostility find their outlet in angry outbursts, sometimes making little sense to listeners. Your anger destroys your ability to think clearly and so you are unable to logically present the reasons for your anger. Since your nerves are also stretched taut, you must be careful or you may suffer from some type of nervous disorder, such as shingles or an ulcer. Anger is very detrimental to the heart, also. You have a tendency to overwork, which is very hard on both your physical body and your nerves. Your approach to life can be too much hustle and bustle, with a lot of running around and nothing being accomplished. Slow down once in a while and chill out.\r\n"},

You may occasionally be accused of cloudy thinking and of letting your imagination run wild. Having visions and wonderful ideas is great, but if you can't implement them in the real world, then much of their use and effectiveness is lost. You need to learn how to discipline your mind so that something real can come of your brilliant inspirations.\r\n\r\nWhen problems become too much for you, you re-create the situation in your mind with the ending you prefer, until you become convinced the new ending is reality. You may have a tendency to run away from the world and its problems. Finding supposed shelter in drugs or alcohol only compounds any problems you have in the first place. Although it may be uncomfortable or even painful, you must learn to face your problems head-on as they will not go away if you ignore them.\r\n\r\nAt times you are very absent-minded and forgetful and there have been a number of others who have thought of you as an air-head. You are not stupid, it's just that your focus and concentration is on another plane. Of course, we do have to live down here on earth, so it would be wise for you to be off in the clouds only when the situation is appropriate. Communication with others may be difficult at times because you are not always clear on what it is that you want to say. Either that, or you describe things in such terms that no one understands what you're saying. Use your ability for artistic expression to communicate your thoughts. Much of your inability to communicate with others is because you are not concentrating. There are times, too, when you perhaps purposely try to mystify or deceive others. You have great difficulty in paying attention and concentrating on anything for very long, except of course, your daydreams.\r\n\r\nYou may have the tendency to believe in everything you hear or to be just the opposite and believe nothing unless you see hard and fast proof. You do not see the world around you accurately, hence you are prone to faulty conclusions. Your mind is highly imaginative and creative and you possess dramatic, artistic, or musical abilities. You perceive things that others do not grasp and understand and you have an amazing ability to read people and situations without being told anything about them. You have a love of mystery and are attracted to metaphysics or occult science, but you need to stay away from negative psychic practices such as Ouija boards, s\xE9ances, hypnotism and mediums. There is a need for you to learn to discriminate truth from fiction and reality from fantasy. You are accused of being a liar at times and it is hard to tell whether you know the difference between truth and falsehood or that you are simply trying to be deceitful on purpose. Some clear thinking on your part could prevent others from getting the feeling that you are intentionally misleading them. You must learn to discipline and focus your mind if you wish to use all your creative talents. You are not particularly good at formal book-learning because you tend to absorb knowledge in an indirect way. It is easier for you to pick up things by having someone tell, describe or show something to you instead of your trying to read about it and understand what you've read. You may have literary talent as you are excellent in describing anything imaginatively. You are a great story-teller. Be careful of the people and environments with which you associate as you are very sensitive to vibrations and tend to soak up the atmosphere that surrounds you.\r\n"},

You love a good mystery and subjects like death and dying, reincarnation, sex and mystical or natural methods of healing are of interest to you. You like to know what everyone is doing or thinking, but you rarely divulge what is on your mind. Because of your love of research and investigation you may well be attracted to the fields of psychotherapy, psychoanalysis, psychiatry or counseling in general. You have great powers of concentration and a penetrating mind. You are able to size up people and situations quickly and accurately. You are keenly observant and very little gets by you. You have sort of an x-ray vision regarding the motivations and intentions of others. The occult side of life fascinates you and gives you plenty of scope for your researching talents and interests. Stories of mystery, intrigue, espionage, science fiction, etc. are favorite reading for you. You may have a morbid side to you because of all this interest in underground or undercover subjects. But that is not the way you see it at all. You just want to learn everything you can about subjects that most people couldn't care less about. You have strong opinions with the power to influence others. Some may think you are almost fanatical or obsessive about your beliefs or what you choose to direct your thinking upon. Just remember to keep an open mind to all points of view. With that attitude you will learn even more about the things you study. Lastly, you may have a highly geared nervous system which can cause impatience and irritability. You must learn when you need to give your mind a rest.\r\n\r\nYou tend to have a very suspicious, even paranoid, side. You need to learn not to be so intensely involved with your own ideas and beliefs, as some of your beliefs may be downright fanatical. When others do not believe the same way as you, you may have a tendency to get angry or self-righteous. You need to learn to listen calmly to other viewpoints and consider whether yours is in error. Be big enough to admit when you are wrong. The attitude you may have that you are always right is just not reality. Keep an open mind before ridiculing any idea. This aspect can give the \"doubting Thomas\" tendency whereby you believe in nothing unless the evidence is displayed to you first-hand.

It would at times, though, be to your advantage and listen to new concepts and to try them occasionally. Be careful that you do not get into the habit of rationalizing everything such that any means to an end is acceptable as long as you believe it. You have a tendency to go to extremes with details.

You tend to put your loved one on a pedestal and this can bring problems because when the loved one eventually does something to \"fall from grace\", then huge disappointment and disillusionment set in and you are crushed. You need to stop looking at the world through rose-colored glasses and see things for how and what they really are.\r\n\r\nAnother facet of this aspect is that you may have such an ideal mate built up in your own imagination that no real person could ever come close to your fantasy. You may spend your entire lifetime looking for Mr. or Ms. Perfect such that you miss Mr. or Ms. Right.

Channel your hormonal energies into things creative, such as art, music, poetry, sculpture, drama, etc. You must not allow yourself to become too self-indulgent or hedonistic. Feelings of jealousy, envy and possessiveness must be controlled or any relationship will be eventually destroyed. You need to develop your self-confidence so that feelings of insecurity do not drive you over the edge. All these experiences all meant to force you to reconsider and transform your values.\r\n"},
  {pn1: 3, pn2: 6, name: "blending", title: "Venus blending with Saturn", body: "Intimacy with another does not come easy for you. You have been hurt in the past and you are reluctant to open up to others because you fear being hurt again. It is painful to relive bad experiences and you have sort of resolved within yourself that if you do not get involved, then you won't get hurt. As Simon and Garfunkle once said, \"I am a rock, I am an island\". As a result of your experiences, people may think you are cold, aloof, unfeeling and uncaring. The challenge here is for you to learn to open up and warm up to people, regardless of the possible consequences. You need to remember that you cannot find true love if you are unwilling to first give love, regardless of the results. Love is not barter and you cannot expect everyone you love to love you back. That is not how it works. This aspect is trying to teach you that love is universal, all-encompassing and should be doled out with no strings attached.\r\n\r\nYou find it difficult to trust people because of past painful experiences, so it takes time for you to take down all your barriers and defenses. You perhaps feel that you are unworthy of love and you cannot think of many reasons why someone should be able to love you. But, that type of thinking is an illusion. You are entitled to as much love as the next person, but love does carry responsibilities. You are worthy of love and there is a lot to love about you, but you must change your attitudes before you can experience the truth of what I have said. People do care about you, but they will tend to leave you alone if they feel that you are trying to shut them out. Open up your emotions and take your chances. It won't kill you, unless you let it. And that would then be your fault.\r\n\r\nSo, here it is. You need to learn to value and love yourself more and to express your appreciation for others more openly. Not with material gifts, but with honest and true emotion. You have a complex emotional nature and it needs to be examined. You are very loyal and steadfast towards those you love once your emotional needs are understood and that is an admirable trait. You tend to be very serious and responsible in relationships. You may involve yourself with noticeably older or younger partners. Try to be less sensitive and more forgiving when you think a loved one has slighted you. You have a need to feel secure and if you do not, then that tends to throw you for a loop. All manner of negative emotions surface then.\r\n\r\nYou find it difficult to show love physically. Stop being such a miser with your affections as well as with your possessions. You have a stingy streak in you that does not serve you well. After all, you can't take it with you when you go. So use some of it now in order to spread a little happiness. You may have a tendency to equate having things to having security. This is another illusion. You don't really become less secure by giving away possessions. In fact, the only true wealth you have and retain is that which you give away to others. This is another lesson for you to learn. To end on the bright side, you are a reliable friend who can be trusted.\r\n\r\n"},

You are charming, gracious and charitable and you are the model host or hostess. This aspect brings material good fortune, which has been earned from previous lives. If there is a negative here, then it is your tendency towards self-indulgence, over-extravagance and laziness. Sometimes things come to you so easily that you do not appreciate them. Things are most appreciated if one has to work hard for them. There may be a love of rich, sweet food as well as too much of it, hence a tendency to gain weight.

You like getting people together and if it were up to you, you would have the whole world paired off, living happily ever after.\r\n\r\nYou have a strong desire for love and beauty and involving yourself in some type of creative activity, whether it be art, music, sculpture or poetry, would help to satisfy this inner craving. This aspect brings a certain charisma and you seem to naturally draw people around you. You like to socialize and are happiest when surrounded by others. You have a great need to give and receive affection from others. You are warm and demonstrative in your affection for others. You are very much alive and others find this very appealing. Fulfillment and harmony in love is likely for you because you know what you want and need in a romantic sense and you express those desires honestly and openly. You have no hidden agendas.

You are romantic and would like to have a story-book kind of life where you live in bliss with your one and only soulmate. These are indeed high ideals, but it's okay for you to dream because at the same time you are dreaming, you are able to keep your feet on the ground and not get carried away by it all. You are compassionate and seek to help others who are in need. You are a natural \"giver\" and it makes you happy to serve. You want what's best for all concerned and you do not have a problem with your ego getting in the way. You find it difficult to be too assertive as you like peace and harmony, without making waves. You are capable of great sacrifice for those you love and you do not necessarily need to be recognized for that or receive anything in return. You have a mystical side to you and you like being around artistic or mystical people. Church music stirs your soul and is as a breath of fresh air from your true home, the heaven worlds. You may have real talent with music or singing. You are devoted and devotional. You generally root for the underdog and can sometimes be a sucker for a sob story.

You have the ability to use your attractiveness and charm to manipulate others, oftentimes without even realizing it. This aspect gives you the opportunity to transform your values or to be the catalyst to help others transform theirs. There is artistic ability along with a desire to create beauty, harmony and comfort.

Security plays an important part in your life and you have a fine enough opinion about yourself and your own self-worth that problems with insecurity don't cause you much aggravation or upset. Still, you are somewhat reserved in showing your affections as you want to be sure you can trust whomever you are involved with. Your tastes and needs are simple and although you appreciate beauty and luxury, you do not need every luxury and convenience in the world in order to be happy. A person's character and inner nature matter more to you than their appearance. Casual or superficial relationships are not what you want and you aren't looking for them. You understand that the best kind of love takes time to develop and real love only gets better, deeper and more satisfying with age. The friendships you form are generally solid and long-lasting. Stability of emotions is one of your hallmarks. You have an innate sense of duty and responsibility towards your loved ones. Self-control is relatively easy for you to practice.

You make and are drawn into unusual friendships with unusual sorts of people. Many people come and go into and out of your life and they are all there to test or challenge your values and your ability to change and to be flexible. They somehow fill unique needs within you. Same with friends - they come, but they go out of your life when they no longer fulfill a need. You have quite unusual ways of looking at things and you always seem to come up with clever solutions to the problems that are presented to you. Things happen to you quite suddenly, very much out of the blue. You cannot anticipate these events, you can only merely react to them. This is particularly true with love relationships.

  {pn1: 3, pn2: 5, name: "discordant", title: "Venus discordant to Jupiter", body: "There are many possibilities with this aspect. Perhaps you will try to have a relationship with one who has completely different interests than you. Perhaps your devotion to some pet cause is annoying to the one who is nearest and dearest to you. Or you may be financially wasteful or extravagant, or perhaps bombastic in your appearance. There are tendencies here for self-indulgence and over-extravagance and your love or cravings for rich, sweet food can cause you trouble with your health in the form of circulation and weight problems due to excess. Perhaps you do not value what you own because it has all come too easily. Maybe you never really had to work all that hard to accumulate it, since you seem to have the ability to effortlessly attract most everything you need. The challenge here is to balance your desires for material things with your desires for philosophic ideals. Your values will be called into question and you may need to rearrange your priorities. You have an expansive emotional nature and you have the tendency to become involved with that type of love that is commonly referred to as \"blind\" love. Perhaps your feelings of love are motivated by considerations of money, property or social status.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all that is said above, you are basically a warm-hearted and generous person who will come to the aid of friends if they are in need. People know they can count on your emotional and material help without your judging them in the process. You tolerate and accept other people's shortcomings and this goes a long way in keeping harmony, which is something that is really important to you and necessary for your well-being. At times, though, you avoid confronting difficult issues because you don't want to make waves or upset people's feelings. At times you need to be more self-assertive, though, not only because it is right to stand up for your beliefs but also because your needs have to met in order for you to retain a healthy balance. You are a lover of social situations and you like to be surrounded by people. You know how to handle people and still be liked. Being alone with yourself makes you somewhat uncomfortable. You need to learn self-restraint.\r\n"},
  {pn1: 3, pn2: 4, name: "discordant", title: "Venus discordant to Mars", body: "Amongst various possible tendencies are these: Your need to satisfy your own desires before considering other people's needs causes anger and frustration. You suppress your own desires in order to maintain peace, which causes internal conflict within you. Sex and love can cause problems because either you run hot and cold alternately, or you don't know the difference between the two or perhaps you simply have love-hate types of relationships. Your high sex drive can lead you to squander your creative force through sexual excess and sensuality. Perhaps you \"fall\" into love easily with whoever pays you the slightest bit of attention and affection.\r\n\r\nYou are intensely amorous and attractive to the opposite sex and are not inclined to simple, friendly platonic relationships. There is a lot of tension in your love life because you often put your own needs ahead of your partner's or you are impatient when it comes to having your own needs met. You tend to run hot and cold in your relationships. If your partner is hot to trot, then you are not, and when you are ready for action, then your partner is not in the mood. You probably find yourself releasing your \"hate\" through verbal or physical fights when there are differences of opinion with your partner and after your hostility is released, then you once again feel \"love\" for that person. Of course, while your emotions might be back to normal, you partner is still trying to figure out just what happened and what hit them. You are ready to go again, but they are not and you can't understand why. This can create a great deal of frustration and disappointment that you do not easily shrug off because you cannot understand what the other person's \"problem\" is. If you are not in a love relationship, then you want to be in one and if you are, then you don't want to be. Your emotions are not stable and you have problems dealing with them. You are indecisive and your values and standards of behavior change from one moment to the next. You need to learn how to compromise with others so that your anger does not erupt when you do not get your way. Blowing off steam is fine, and perhaps you need to buy yourself a punching bag so you can spar with it when you are upset, but it is not right to use other people, especially loved ones, as verbal punching bags or as objects of your assault tactics. Additionally, you need to overcome your feelings of love and hate toward the people you care about.\r\n"},
  {pn1: 3, pn2: 8, name: "discordant", title: "Venus discordant to Neptune", body: "You tend to be what some people call the hopeless romantic. You are very idealistic about love and romance and many times it isn't so much the case that you love someone or that you are in love with someone as it is that you are in love with love. You tend to put your loved one on a pedestal and this can bring problems because when the loved one eventually does something to \"fall from grace\", then huge disappointment and disillusionment set in and you are crushed. You need to stop looking at the world through rose-colored glasses and see things for how and what they really are. Your ideas about how people ought to relate and love each other get in the way of your actual relationships.\r\n\r\nAnother facet of this aspect is that you may have such an ideal mate built up in your own imagination that no real person could ever come close to your fantasy. You may spend your entire lifetime looking for Mr. or Ms. Perfect such that you miss Mr. or Ms. Right. You become very disillusioned when you discover that no real, flesh-and-blood person ever quite lives up to your dream image of the perfect mate. Come down to earth and realize that no one is perfect and there are no white knights ready to come dashing along to save you. Stop the dreaming but don't give up the dream. Although you frequently fantasize about love and romance, you may avoid becoming intimately involved with anyone or making definite commitments. You can be evasive and dishonest with yourself and others when it comes to love.\r\n\r\nThere is danger of falling into the wrong type of relationship, a relationship of co-dependence. Either you or your partner may enjoy or feel obligated to play the role of martyr, victim or savior. Remember that no good relationship is unequal. Two equal partners who neither feel the need to save or be saved make the best couple.\r\n\r\nYou are a sensitive person who enjoys the finer, aesthetic things in life. You desire harmony and beauty and are probably attracted to the arts in some way, either painting, music, dance, theater or drama. You are perhaps attracted to those with artistic or mystical inclinations. This is a certain charm about you that others find unworldly. The unusual and the intuitive, the sensual and the explorative appeal to you. You are insecure in matters of love. Simply remember that you have human frailty, but do the best you can as that is all the Universe asks of you. Recognize, too, that human weakness exists even in those you love. Sometimes others cannot live up to your expectations, which may be quite unrealistic at times. You may be unrealistic in matters of love. You may believe that if someone loves you enough that they can read your mind. This will set you up for many disappointments because that is just not true. You need to tell people what you want and how you feel. They cannot read your mind no matter how much they love and care about you.\r\n\r\nYou need to transform your material values into spiritual values and to turn personal desires into universal desires. Personal property and possessions may disappear in strange, mysterious ways in order to teach you that material possessions are easily replaced and therefore are of limited value. The only thing you can take with you when you die are your spiritual and personal growth, your experiences. You need to learn to love without expecting love in return. You must learn to forgive and thus release inner resentments. You need to learn how to turn the other cheek while not becoming a doormat for all to walk on. One last thing, do not turn to drugs or alcohol when you feel sorrow or when you feel like escaping from the world. Life must be faced head-on if you are to get anywhere and resorting to drugs or alcohol will only make things much worse.\r\n"},
  {pn1: 3, pn2: 9, name: "discordant", title: "Venus discordant to Pluto", body: "You are drawn to powerful and compelling emotional and sexual attractions and experiences that you may feel you have little choice or control over. You crave intensity and these incidents provide you with the opportunity to satisfy your wanton desires. You feel an overwhelming need for love and you may be emotionally or sexually greedy, insatiable, obsessive or compulsive. You tend to be very jealous of and possessive of the objects of your desires and although you keep tight reins on your partners, you do not want them to question or control you in any way. This makes for very one-sided types of relationships. You need to become aware that your jealous and possessive traits will drive away those you profess to love. Power struggles are likely in your relationships as you want to wear the pants, yet you continually attract that same sort of person for a partner. Your love life is passionate and often explosive and painful, but you don't seem to mind because the intensity helps make you feel that you are alive.\r\n\r\nThe challenge here is to transform your values. Important psychological problems are being worked out because of and through your relationships with others. Because of this you may attract people and friends who act destructively towards you. The reason this happens is because these people are mirroring the same type of acts you yourself have done in former lives. You are now reaping what you have sown previously. You are being given the chance to wipe your slate clean if you do not respond to evil with evil. Release all thoughts of revenge and learn to turn the other cheek. When your debts are paid and your lessons are learned, then destructive people will no longer be part of your life. This aspect shows a readiness on your part to atone for past mistakes and cruelties.\r\n\r\nIn matters of health, this aspect tends to interfere with the magnetic forces in the veins and prevents proper drainage of toxins and waste material from the tissues. It can also hinder the filtering process in the kidneys. This leads to improper cleansing of the blood, with the result that toxins and waste material seek exit through the lungs and skin in the form of lung congestions and skin eruptions. The spiritual lesson here is to let go of ill feelings (emotional toxins) and forgive (elimination, transformation), rather than trying to get even or seeking revenge.\r\n\r\nOn the positive side, you do have the emotional power and unusual creativity to bring about beneficial and healing changes into the lives of others if you can focus on other's needs instead of your own.\r\n\r\n"},

You believe that everything must be earned and paid fo -  there are no free lunches. Because you find it difficult to express your feelings, you tend to show people how you feel by buying them gifts as a substitute for you and your feelings. If they reject your gift, then this is easier to take than if they reject you. Though you crave love and affection, intimacy is difficult for you. You have a shallow opinion of yourself and your own worth and talents. You do not understand why anyone could possibly love you. You feel that you are unlovable. This is something you need to strongly work on as your life will continue to be miserable if you do not learn to change your attitude. You are as worthy of love as anyone else, but you must come to realize that for yourself. Do not let past experiences govern your actions and feelings for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nYou are a serious and reserved person who appears to others as cold, aloof, unfeeling and uncaring. You are not necessarily these things, it's just that you are very cautious in letting anyone see the real you or in letting people get close to you. You want to love and be loved, but you find this very difficult. You need to remember that you first have to give love to get love. And you can't buy real love. It doesn't work that way. You find it difficult to enjoy yourself in a light-hearted, open and playful way. You understand work, duty and responsibility a lot better than you understand feelings, affection and love. Rarely do you do anything for pleasure. If something involves work or getting something done, then that is pleasure for you. Other people do not understand that about you. There are times, though, when you procrastinate and put off attending to necessities with the result that duties tend to pile up. You need to learn how to balance the seriousness with life and the enjoyment of life.\r\n\r\nYou may become romantically involved with people who do not value you or treat you well. You need to learn to love and value yourself before you will find happiness in love. Security is very important to you, yet you do not know how to feel secure. Your fear of loss, of money, property, loved ones, etc., makes you very insecure. This negativity colors all your relationships for the worse. You must learn how to trust again. You must learn how to face your fears, even if it is painful. This is the only way you will ever overcome them.\r\n\r\nYou have the tendency to lose your faith and your optimism when life presents problems with which you must cope. It's fine to have a well-developed sense of responsibility, but you must also learn to trust in divine wisdom which has attracted these difficulties to you to help you develop personal and soul growth. You better than most can understand that the purpose of life is not happiness, but experience. Yet that does not mean you have to live your entire life feeling miserable. You may feel lonely, but this is because you are unwilling or unable to see that people really do love you. As I have mentioned previously, the problem may lie in your own opinion of yourself. You must first become a loving person yourself in order to attract love.\r\n\r\nYou may become defensive about expressing your real likes and dislikes for fear of being criticized or put down. You may have a jealous and possessive streak in you such that when you are in a relationship, you do anything and everything in your power to try to hold on to what you have. Of course this makes your partner feel as though they are in prison and they will try to escape the first chance they get, which is what you are fearful of in the first place. You must realize that you can never hold on to anything that doesn't want to be held on to. Love is free and there should be no contingencies placed upon it.

You love challenges and if someone tells you something can't be done, then that makes you want to give it a go even more. No matter how much you accomplish, you will probably never rest on your laurels. There are always more challenges ahead of you and you actively seek them out. You are forward-looking, enterprising and enthusiastic about new projects. You are not happy in situations that do not offer you challenges and the potential for growth and expansion in the future - no matter how secure or satisfactory they may be in other respects. People probably think you are very competitive, but you are mainly in competition with yourself, to see how far you can go and how much you can accomplish. You have leadership abilities because you inspire courage, confidence and enthusiasm in others. You have the spark of life and your vitality is strong, so your health is generally good. Any problems that may set in are probably due to burnout rather than anything else. Because you are so strongly driven by challenge, you may lose interest in things or people if you do not feel challenged. This tendency can affect your love life as you may continually change partners to try and find one who can keep up with you or keep you on your toes.

You tend to pass judgment very quickly, regardless of whether or not you have all the facts. This also gets you into trouble at times. Try to curb any tendency you have in needing to be right all the time. Your ego can get rather large at times and it wouldn't hurt you to show some humility and modesty at times and also to say you're sorry for wrong actions and words.

Artistic, musical or dramatic ability is within you if you can organize and discipline yourself to actually doing the work it takes to bring things to fruition.

There are times when you just drift through life, hoping that something or someone will spring up and put you on the right course. You need to learn how to make your own decisions and take responsibility for them. You have a passive side and at times lack the will power, physical energy, strength, and the fighting spirit to achieve your aims, stand up for your beliefs or to confront the people you need to be assertive with.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of powerful magnetic energy here with this aspect and you will find that you are drawn to people or circumstances in strange and unusual ways. Manipulation and fraud can be part of these experiences and you may be on both the giving and the receiving end of things. You may have difficulty recognizing or telling the truth and you may encounter people who are also this way. In any case you need to be careful about the sorts of people you meet and establish relationships with.\r\n\r\nAccept responsibilities and discipline in this life. That is the message of this aspect. Do not try to run away from your troubles and especially do not try to avoid them through drugs or alcohol. Stay away from negative psychic influences such as Ouija boards, s\xE9ances, hypnotism and mediums. There is an urgent need for you to be totally honest with yourself and others.\r\n"},

When you want something, I mean, you really want something and you do whatever it takes to get what you want. Hopefully, you will go about this in the right manner, respecting the wishes and needs of others rather than simply walking over whomever you feel is getting in your way. You are very zealous and almost fanatical when you get an idea into your head. This makes you capable of great reform and great construction or destruction, depending on how you employ your energies. You are strong-willed and stubborn and you never say die. You have more endurance than most of those around you and if you are in a position of leadership, it would be well for you to remember that others do not possess the energy and stamina that you have. So be careful you do not become the proverbial slave-driver.\r\n\r\nSometimes in the pursuit of your goals, you lose all objectivity and are completely driven by your desires and your passions. At times like this you let no one stand in your way. You insist on being completely right about everything you say or do. You have a large and powerful ego and it might be well for you to remember that humility and modesty make for easier going rather than an over-inflated ego. At least your co-workers and associates will think so.\r\n\r\nPower fascinates you and most things you do may be because you want more and more control, over things, situations and people. This can make you a real tyrant to be around. Your tendency is not so much to work around things as it is to run over things, especially anything that gets in your way. You can accomplish so much if you will just be aware that some methods are more productive than others in the long run. You can be ruthless and impersonal when it comes to achieving your ambitions and goals in life. You have enormous energy and are capable of extraordinary effort and great achievement. You can also become a compulsive workaholic.\r\n\r\nYou have the ability to exercise subtle control over others. This can make it easy for you to manipulate others. I hope you remember two things. No one likes to be manipulated and you will eventually reap all that you have sown. You are a natural detective and ferret. Nothing escapes you as you have the ability to correctly size up people and situations. You may have difficulty in expressing your warmth and affection for others. At times you need to lighten up. You have the ability to accept life as you find it, without wishing everything to be different.\r\n"},

You are self-controlled, dedicated, organized, systematic, thorough, disciplined and patient in the way you go about things. You are a born leader who has executive ability and great powers of concentration. People may see you as a bit of a stuffed-shirt, but they know they can count on you as you take your duties and responsibilities very seriously. They trust you to come through for them, regardless.\r\n\r\nYou meet obstacles and life without emotion and you will struggle patiently through difficult circumstances. Most of the time you feel that you must rely on yourself alone, that it's all on your shoulders. You can be a harsh disciplinarian, expecting far too much from yourself and others. There are times when you doubt your own power and ability. You fear failure and that is why you will do anything in order to keep it from happening. There are times when it seems that every roadblock in the world is thrown at you, keeping you from initiating the things you have planned. Your solution is to dig down deep and work longer and harder. Your powers of determination and endurance are what make you succeed.\r\n\r\nYou have great drive, ambition, vitality and strategy. You desire to build and leave lasting structure. There is focus upon power and leadership. At times you may be too conservative and unwilling to take the risks that are sometimes necessary for success. Do not let fear keep you from making calculated, educated risks. Develop confidence in your own abilities. You may not be a genius but remember what Thomas Edison said, \"Success is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration\". Remember that you do have an extraordinary capacity to sustain your concentration until your projects are completely finished.\r\n\r\nWhen you are frustrated, you may have difficulty controlling your anger, which can be quite explosive since you tend to hold in your hostilities. You should learn to verbally express your resentments before you become so uncontrollable. If you find it impossible to talk about your resentments, then you should write them down and then reread them. If your anger goes away upon re-reading your notes, then you can destroy them. If not, then you should deliver them to whomever has caused your frustration, with the idea of talking about the frustrations when the paper has been read. You need to remember that bottling anger up inside you is one of the primary causes of gall and kidney stones. Controlling passionate desires may also need doing as unruly desires can get you in a lot of trouble if left unchecked.\r\n"},

Yet you do have extraordinary drive and energy and can accomplish a great deal for good or ill depending on whether you use your energy constructively or destructively. You are impatient and want what you want when you want it, and NOW! You act quickly, impulsively and decisively. There are no half-way measures with you - it's all or nothing. You require a great deal of personal freedom and you dislike conforming to the schedules and rules imposed by others. Your rashness and carelessness can bring accidents because you are too often in a hurry. You like to be on the go and it is hard for you to stay in one place for very long. You tend to get bored easily and are always looking for new challenges, excitement and risk. You generally dislike authority unless you are the one wielding the power. You are frank and outspoken and you tell people exactly what you want them to hear - there's no second guessing with you. Formalities and tact do not mean too much to you most of the time. You can be a terrific agent for change if you apply yourself because you love to reform and will try to make changes in whatever you undertake. All that nervous energy you have makes you tense and high-strung and it is many times difficult for you to relax. You are restless, daring and experimental and you'll try almost anything at least once. You are mentally bright with much ingenuity and mechanical ability. Dangerous occupations appeal to you.\r\n\r\nThis aspect bestows upon you great vitality, honesty, intuition and courage. But it is essential for you to learn to take instruction and to listen to other people's viewpoints with an open mind, because this develops the self-discipline you need.

You don't hold onto grudges and you don't resort to mean acts to get even with people for real or imagined slights. You enjoy anything that will help stretch your limits - traveling, education, philosophy, religion. You enjoy adventure, taking risks, sports and outdoor activities. You may be good in sports but may not exercise the appropriate discipline to really excel. You are usually very optimistic and enthusiastic and pretty much always retain a positive attitude towards life. This aspect may help bring you wealth, but at the same time it may also bring a free-spending attitude with it. You tend to be lucky in speculation and you are generous with all you have. You have faith in the future and usually do not worry about what you need for tomorrow. You are recognized for your integrity, sincerity and honesty.

You like to work with others for some cause that will benefit those around you who are less fortunate than you. In your mind serving them is one of the best ways to reach for God. And you are correct in that notion. You have a flair for the dramatic, the musical, the artistic and the poetic. Channeling your energies into these sorts of activities helps keep you in a positive frame of mind and emotion. It also helps you keep control of your imagination so your thoughts and ideas don't run away with you. You have the ability to bring your dreams into reality, for you tend to be a practical idealist. You have a mystical side to you and you may be attracted to the occult. There is a personal magnetism about you that attracts others, especially those in need. You have the ability to be patient and lovingly assertive. Because of your kindnesses to others in past lives, you have some degree of spiritual protection from hidden enemies who might seek to undo you.

You have a positive blend of boldness and caution most of the time. In previous lives you have done a fine job of balancing your desires with a sense of responsibility.

You are also able to become so devoted to something or someone that you give up all personal desires and passions. You have to decide which path you are going to follow.\r\n\r\nYou are ambitious, enterprising, self-confident and you have a strong desire to succeed in a big way. But, you can come across at times as being too forceful or aggressive in your desire to succeed in life. You are constantly looking for new opportunities, new experiences and new knowledge. Travel, either physical or mental, can be an avenue for you in this quest. You love taking risks if you think this will help you come out ahead, either financially or otherwise. But you should be careful as you are prone to bad judgment, bad luck and overdoing your speculative activities. Stay away from gambling because if you happen to \"catch the bug\", it could ruin you.\r\n\r\nYou have the tendency to overextend yourself, promise more than you can deliver and at times you exaggerate the truth for effect or for personal gain. You do so because of an overly optimistic or overly confident assessment of your own capacities and abilities. No matter how much you accomplish, you never seem to be completely satisfied. You always feel you can do more or that you should be doing more, so you set your sights on yet another goal. Perhaps you need to search for yourself within.\r\n\r\nGet in the habit of planning ahead so that you do not rush yourself and thus put yourself at greater risk of an accident through carelessness and hurry. Forethought will also help you to be more considerate of others, as you are apt to be thoughtless, without meaning to cause pain. You enjoy competition and challenge. You like the chase more than the conquest. Life at times is a big game for you. You will find that you will get along far better with others if you learn to work in cooperative harmony rather than in competition.\r\n\r\nAlthough you have potential athletic ability, which would be a constructive use of your energy and competitive nature, it is wondered whether or not you possess the necessary self-discipline in order to be truly great or successful. You have an abundance of physical energy and are generally very optimistic. There is danger of dissipating yourself through extravagance or self-indulgence. Self-control is required. There may be trouble through legal matters. Practice balancing your enthusiasm and your aggressiveness in how you deal with others. Guard against working too fast as this sometimes makes your work sloppy or half-finished. Part of the reason for working too fast is your restlessness, which creates a need to be on the move a lot.\r\n"},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 8, name: "discordant", title: "Mars discordant to Neptune", body: "The danger with this aspect is that you tend to want to escape from reality and avoid your day-to-day duties and responsibilities. If this escapism tendency is carried too far, you may seek outlet through drugs or alcohol, both of which will eventually ruin your life. Ordinary life seems dull and drab to you and you feel a need for something that stirs your imagination, some vision or ideal or cause that motivates you. Without such an impetus you tend to procrastinate doing the things in your life that you need to be doing. People count on you and you let them down in any manner of ways. People then lose their respect for you and eventually avoid having anything whatsoever to do with you. You may have difficulty separating truth from fiction or fantasy from reality. You need to stay grounded and disciplined so that you can remain functional. Yes, it's true that your real home is in the spiritual worlds, yet you must live your earth life here and learn as much as you can from your experiences in concrete existence. That is what we are all here for. So stop thinking about skipping out on the school of life and get back to business.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, though, that you can really pursue your dreams and bring them into reality. You have the ability to do this if you approach it the right way. The right way is in staying focused, centered and disciplined. Nothing worthwhile can be accomplished without discipline and you need to realize that if you do not already. You are an artist at heart, whether your medium is song, dance, drama, poetry, music, art or painting. Any of these allow you to express the feelings you have inside and that gives your emotions release from the day-to-day tribulations of living. Your imagination is capable of quite a great deal if you will simply keep it in check and not allow it to run away from you.\r\n\r\nWork that serves only your own narrow personal interests does not satisfy you. You need something more in your life than just living for yourself. You may lack the competitive edge, the fighting spirit, the me-first attitude that is often required for material advancement and success. Of course you simply may not have much earthly ambition. You also have the tendency to either overestimate or underestimate your own power and abilities. There is deception and self-delusion present, either on your part or on the part of others that you come into contact with. You are an easy target for swindlers and con-men because you are a sucker for a sob story. You must realize that most people have to learn to help themselves. You cannot save the world, as much as you might like to do so. The only one you can save is yourself. And that is no easy task for any of us.\r\n\r\nThere is the tendency here to get involved in co-dependent relationships. Either you or your partner or both knowingly or unknowingly play the role of martyr, victim or savior. You must realize that any relationship that isn't based on equality is eventually doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nThis aspect may make your nature coarse and sensual, impulsive and irascible, militant and extravagant in speech and action, self-indulgent to a degree in whatever direction your passions may lead you and unable to exercise restraint over yourself in any direction. It tends to give a fanatical spirit which may express itself in either religion or atheism. There can be tendencies toward lawlessness. Self-control is the saving grace that you need to develop.\r\n\r\nYou do have talent, even though it is easier for you to doubt your abilities and to question your own worth. Your lack of self-esteem is distorting the truth and you must work your way through the illusion. The challenge is to conquer discouragement. You see failure as an indication of your unworthiness to merit rewards or success. To dissipate your feelings of unworthiness, you may resort to placing the blame for your failure upon others until your gossiping even convinces you it is the truth. Eventually, when the real truth is revealed, you suffer greatly, for you have made yourself unbelievable to others. You could save yourself much inner distress if you would recognize that failures are simply spiritual stumbling blocks which test everyone's courage in picking themselves up again without emotional turmoil. Any suffering you experience will, in the long run, teach you obedience and that is one of the roads that leads to God. Self-forgetting service to others is another road that is safe and sure.\r\n\r\nBe careful of the people and situations you associate with as not everyone is really whom they say they are. Some may be secret enemies from past lives who are conscious or unconscious agents of God acting so that you may reap what you have sown previously. Stay away from negative psychic influences such as Ouija boards, s\xE9ances, hypnotism and mediums. There is an urgent need for you to be totally honest with yourself and others.\r\n"},

You have strong desires and passions and when you want something, you pursue it obsessively and relentlessly until you achieve or obtain it. You may be so driven by your desire that you lose all objectivity. Compulsive, obsessive behavior is possible with this aspect and you need to control your fanatical tendencies. Your desire for power and control over others is probably quite developed and you need to watch this as no one likes feeling controlled. You should know that as you hate restraint and dislike taking orders.\r\n\r\nYou have a secret side to you and will not reveal your intentions to others until it best suits your purpose. You want to know everything about others, yet at the same time you do not want to tell them anything. You always try to keep the upper hand, no matter what the subject or situation. You love intensity and whether the outcome is good or bad does not matter half as much as long as the experience you gained was intense. Power struggles and relationships with a strong dominance/submissiveness motif are also likely.\r\n\r\nYou have enormous energy reserves, stamina and endurance and you need to remember that those around you do not as a rule share this same characteristic. Don't drive the people around you too hard for they probably do not have the ability to withstand all the stress, hard work and pressure that you are able to endure. You don't want to be known as a slave-driver, do you? Don't laugh. Learn to control and properly channel your energies.\r\n\r\nWith all that has been said, it should be obvious to you that you are capable of extraordinary effort and great achievement if you will direct your energies along positive lines. You can be a great force for good or ill, it all depends on how you direct your mind, your will and your desires.\r\n\r\nTry to better learn how to work more in harmony with others. Cooperation will truly get you further ahead than competition. You don't want to make enemies on your way the ladder because you will meet those same enemies on the way down. And you will go down if you use under-handed or illegal methods to carry out your plans. Listen to other people's ideas and consider them for you may hear something you hadn't thought about before and learn from it. Even though you think you are mostly right, you can still learn a thing or two by listening and keeping an open mind. Give people a chance to express themselves and don't give them all the answers even if you know them. That way you will be serving them and building up treasure for yourself at the same time. One last point, it might be wise for you to remember that being excessively stubborn can easily turn friends into enemies.\r\n"},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 6, name: "discordant", title: "Mars discordant to Saturn", body: "Energetic drives collide with conservatism and caution. This aspect in its worst expression tends to make you cruel, cold and unfeeling. You keep anger and resentment within you and you do not forget nor forgive a wrong. Revenge is on your mind and you want to pay back those people who have gotten in your way, either in reality or simply just in your mind. But this aspect can also give a very determined and ambitious nature. It can make a person persevere, endure, struggle and work hard, in spite of difficulties and discouragement. In its usual influence it tends to make you run hot and cold or it continually puts roadblocks and obstacles in your way to test you and see what you are made of. It is not a pleasant aspect, yet it can give you the drive and determination to succeed in spite of all the setbacks and frustrations. It can be a real character-builder if you can stand the pressure.\r\n\r\nBy concentrating on a single, clearly defined goal, you can accomplish much, but you often feel that the journey is quite difficult and that you must struggle on alone with all the responsibility and obligation on your shoulders. Now you know how Atlas must have felt carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. You are capable of great self-control, great self-denial and great self-discipline. You can be very rough on yourself by expecting far too much out of yourself. You are sometimes held back by your own fear and the uncertainty of your own abilities. Self-confidence sometimes wanes as the work goes on without noticeable progress. You meet great resistance at times when you try to take the initiative or when you try to be assertive. An inferiority complex may emerge out of accumulated difficulties. This leads to anger and frustration and if you do not have some positive way of releasing this stress, you will quite nearly explode. Of course the people whom you take all this out on are those you are closest to. This creates a great deal of friction and animosity. For this reason you many times work better in solitude. This aspect tends to cause delays, frustrations, disruptions and obstacles to all that you try to do. It certainly will test your patience.\r\n\r\nYou need to determine what your responsibilities are and when you can safely pursue your own desires while still meeting and living up to the duties you are committed to. If you follow your own desires, then you will be looked upon as irresponsible and selfish. And if you never allow yourself to pursue your own desires, then you may tear yourself apart. The trick is to find the right balance between these areas. Part of the problem lies in that you often feel frustrated, because you assume you have no choice in doing anything you enjoy. This causes the anger to build up, making you sarcastic, bitter and resentful. Make a list of your true responsibilities and fulfill them. Then, make a list of what you would like to do for fun and relaxation. By compromising, you can release your overactive sense of responsibility. You are a skilled worker because of your organizing ability and your attentiveness to detail. You take pride in your work and you simply want to do a good job.\r\n\r\nI will add to this that the challenge with this aspect is to see the beauty and goodness in the world that surrounds you. Because of all your troubles you tend to see life as cruel and hateful, with everyone pitted against everyone else. Life seems incredibly hard with this perspective. What you must try to do is to see the good within the world's disharmony. You need love and support yet these may be lacking. To get love you first have to give love and it is not particularly easy for you to open your emotions to others. You have been hurt in the past and you do not like emotional pain. So it takes you a while to open up to people. Because of your nature, then, you appear serious, cold and aloof to others. They have no idea of what is going on inside you.\r\n\r\nAs alluded to earlier, you tend to hold in your anger. If you do not learn to release your frustrations, this anger can and will erupt uncontrollably. You need to remember that bottling anger up inside you is one of the primary causes of gall and kidney stones. Other thoughts - learn to control your passionate desires because unruly desires can get you in a lot of trouble if left unchecked. Also, there will be times when you may not follow through on projects that you have initiated because you lack a sense of sustained purpose. There can also be a certain callousness with this aspect such that you may become selfish and unwilling to go out of your way for others unless there is some gain in it for you.\r\n"},

You must learn patience and if you are unwilling to do so on your own, then the Universe will send you the people and the situations necessary so that you will learn.

You are apt to view some people through rose-colored glasses and others through jaundiced eyes. If you place people on pedestals, and if they fall off, you become disillusioned, not only with the idolized individual, but with the world. You have high ideals, but by accepting life and people as they are, you can release the disappointments and disillusionments you suffer over human failings.

Give some money or time to charity. You will be rewarded for your philanthropic and benevolent actions. Watch what you spend. Keep it in line with your budget. The secret is to do but not to overdo."},

Spend your energy doing constructive work. Clean the garage, work on your car, go play with friends, go outside and get some good, clean exercise. If you do not find a constructive outlet for your energy today, you may experience irritability, anger, impatience and carelessness. Be alert today and don't let any impatience or carelessness lead to accidents. Watch yourself around hot water and sharp objects."},

Do all your errands today. Your mind is active and it may be difficult at times to slow it down and relax. Your nerves are wound up and it may be necessary for you at some time today to force yourself to seek a quiet place and recoup your strength. Watch a tendency to argue with friends, display impatience, especially while driving, and to generally be on edge. Do not let your high energy level today cause you to become reckless or careless. Pay attention to the things you do and slow down a bit. Remember, discipline. You feel very self-assertive today. Do not let your ego ride roughshod over the people you deal with today. Control your temper AND your tongue. Avoid petty gossip and talking about people behind their backs."},

Your feelings may be sensitive and you may feel as if you are being intentionally slighted by people even when you are not. Be a duck and let the water run off your back. Put your ego in the background. Direct energy into nurturing or caring for something or someone you care for. Go out and do your garden work. Take a walk and get in closer contact with nature. Mow the lawn. This will help you keep your mind off yourself. Forget the things from the past that bug you and move on. Don't let the little habits and idiosyncrasies of friends or foes get the better of you. Keep your temper and hold your tongue. Be pleasant and courteous to women today."},

Take that energy and direct it into something constructive like writing or creative visualization. Let your imagination take you into new areas of thought and possibilities. Put energy into making your dreams a reality. Don't waste time fantasizing, make something happen. Finish that art project, complete the painting you've been meaning to finish, read that metaphysical book you've been wanting to start/finish. Watch for someone playing on your sympathies. Do not be taken in by every sob story you hear today. Get the facts. Help someone less fortunate if you are able. Visit a sick friend and cheer them up."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 9, name: "Conjunction", title: "Mars Conjunct Pluto", body: "You may be tempted to bully people into doing your will. The spirit of competition is strong, but try to be cooperative instead. Much can be accomplished if you will use your energies and your indomitable will together, in harmony. Do not try to control people or events. Concentrate on doing your best and things will work out the way they are supposed to. People who are coerced to do your will, will at some time try to even up the score. It's not worth it. Avoid power struggles and be aware that someone might try to control you. If so, all you have to do is stand up for your rights."},

Do not let this aggravate you or there will be a price to pay. Try to remember that much good can come about by blending the discipline and controlled nature of Saturn with the actions and energies of Mars. This is a good time to get organized and get down to serious business. Tackle something you've been meaning to do for a long time. Saturn's staying power and the energy of Mars can help you see the job through. Watch out for bumps and bruises today, as you may be more susceptible to falls and accidents. Do not try to force things today and be patient. Impatience against restraint can be your downfall. Try to find the good if you feel something or someone is trying to hold you back. It might be in your best interest."},

Be careful not to get into arguments with your superiors or with people in authority, like policemen. Avoid confrontations that involve your ego. Instead, channel the energy and potential hostility into something creative like your favorite hobby. The important thing is to express yourself in a constructive manner. How about playing in the park with a group of children? Do not overexert yourself or put too much strain on your heart. This means controlling your temper. Anger is one of the hardest things on your heart. Don't lay out in the sun too long. You may burn easier today than normal. Watch yourself around the stove or anything hot. Focus on being humble. Put your ego in the backseat."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 7, name: "Conjunction", title: "Mars Conjunct Uranus", body: "Today is the day to be mellow. This may be difficult to do as your body and your nerves are probably racing in all sorts of directions. Acting rashly or in a headstrong manner may lead to an accident. Be careful and slow things down a little. Watch your driving today and do not speed. Mechanical devices may be dangerous if you do not stay alert and careful. The main thing today is to avoid carelessness and haste. Expect the unexpected and plan ahead for any contingencies. The rebel in you is likely to come out today. Don't burn any bridges behind you. You may need them later on. Also keep in mind that others may need an extra measure of freedom and independence today as well as yourself. Watch the tendency to be selfish and demanding. Do not feel annoyed by a perceived lack of freedom. True freedom comes from within, not from without."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 3, name: "Conjunction", title: "Mars Conjunct Venus", body: "There is a desire for love, beauty, relationships, and things that feel good. Desire is strong today and this includes the desire for the opposite sex. Be considerate of others today as you may express yourself too strongly. Use your creative energies and get involved with the arts, music or the theater. How about making a special meal for your significant other? Watch your spending today as you may feel tempted to overindulge and be too extravagant. Curb your potential for eating too much rich, sweet, or spicy food. Moderation is the key. Be refined and charming around women. Do not get involved in petty gossip or in competition with the women you know. Have fun at a social gathering, but remember, don't come on too strong or let your opinion of yourself swell so as to become overbearing and obnoxious."},

You may have promised more than you can deliver and now may be the time when people feel as if you've let them down. This is not the time to get involved in a risky business or investment opportunity. Pull in the reins a little and curb your desire to overspend. You must guard against over-optimism and overconfidence. The desire to take risks may be high today. If you choose that route, just remember that a little restraint can go a long way and may save you trouble and financial loss down the road. Go get some exercise and you will probably feel better."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 4, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Mars", body: "You want to assert and exert yourself today. Meanwhile, others are engaged in doing the same. This can lead to ego confrontations and relationship problems. Two people cannot wear the same pair of pants at the same time. Speak your mind today, but do so in a cool, calm manner. Otherwise, the people you want to hear you will turn a deaf ear and nothing will be accomplished. The secret is to use tact. Tell the truth, state your case, and do not seek to blame, criticize or judge another's actions. That will only antagonize them further and nothing will be resolved. Separate your ego from all encounters today and do not take things personally. View all criticisms of you as constructive criticisms and just try to be the best you can be."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 2, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Mercury", body: "There is plenty of energy for thinking, reading, writing and speaking today. The trouble is that you may speak too much of your mind and others may not be receptive to your opinions today. Do not beat them over the head trying to get them to see your point of view. Listen to their point of view. You might learn something new and useful. Things will probably go better for you today if you listen more than talk. Be tolerant of others' beliefs and opinions. You can win new friends if you exercise that discipline. If you like to argue, then this is the day you may get your fill. Remember, you probably can't or won't change someone's mind, so apply your energy more constructively. Be careful while driving. Don't be in such a hurry to get where you are going or else you may become involved in an accident."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 1, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Moon", body: "The people closest to you may get on your nerves today or YOU may get on their nerves. The little habits of people may be irritating to you. Relax and don't let it get to you. This too shall pass. It might be helpful to remember that they are experiencing the same aggravations as you. Cut everyone some slack today. The ones you are emotionally involved with may be the ones you vent your frustrations on. Not nice! Go out of your way to be considerate of people today, especially women. Try to empathize with others and understand their feelings. Put yourself in their shoes and get in touch with your feelings, with your feminine side. The day will go by much better if you try this approach. Don't come on too strongly. Back off a little."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 8, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Neptune", body: "Your relationships with people today may involve the quality of deception. Either you are not being honest with them or they are not being honest with you. Be careful of people who come to you with hard luck stories and ask for your help. They may really need your help or they may just be trying to scam you. Use discrimination. Not everyone who asks for help deserves your help. It may be better to let them help themselves. Knowing the difference is one of the most difficult things to learn. Certainly do nothing today that isn't entirely above board or you will pay for it dearly later on. Honesty is the best policy. Misunderstandings can occur so mirror back to others what you understand them to have said and see if they agree with your interpretation. You may feel more sensitive today than usual. Don't feel bad if your ego feels bruised. Things may not be as they appear."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 9, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Pluto", body: "Power struggles and competition characterize this aspect. You may feel at odds with the people you have to deal with today. Your opinions and theirs seem to clash and there doesn't appear to be much common ground. There is, you just have to dig a little deeper to find it. Just make sure that you don't so antagonize people now that you can't work with them in the future. It will not do any good to burn bridges now no matter what the situation. Keep your cool and realize that tomorrow is another day. State your case, listen to theirs and then sleep on it. Things have a way of appearing different after a time. Don't expect to be able to bully people into your way of thinking. Avoid fist fights."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 6, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Saturn", body: "You may feel rather restrained and too disciplined by others at this time. You may feel purposely held back from doing the things you want to do. This can cause great frustration and great annoyance. Please try to make the best of it and do not try to get even with them or try to get back at them. The repercussions will only boomerang back to you. If others do not appreciate you at this time, just realize that it is best if you continue working hard, doing the best you can until this combination of energies passes. This can be a stressful aspect but do not fret and let it get to you and upset your health. Guard against falls, bumps and bruises. Wait this aspect out and your energies and freedom to do the things you desire will return. In the meantime, work hard and stay optimistic. Express your frustrations in a cool, calm manner. Don't keep everything inside."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 0, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Sun", body: "You may feel anger towards others at this time. Perhaps it is because they do not agree with the way you go about doing the things you do. Perhaps you do things in a way which you know will antagonize them. Perhaps you are trying to get even with them by doing things in such a way so as to irritate them. They may be doing the same things to get back at you for something. In any case, frustrations and irritations with others are characteristic during this transit. Protect yourself around anything having to do with heat. Stay out of the sun and watch yourself around the stove or oven. Ego conflicts are likely during this time. Keep your cool and let the energies pass. Instead, apply yourself to work and physical exercise. Do not get into any kind of argument or disagreement with your superiors or the police."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 7, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Uranus", body: "You may feel like rebelling against the people you are around today. There is a certain rashness with you and you may feel tempted to let loose in any kind of manner. This impulsiveness, this rashness may lead to accidents and hurt relationships. You need your freedom and others probably need theirs. So hang loose and give people some space. Change at any cost may be what you're feeling today, but carefully consider the costs before you leap into action. The costs may be too high. Look before you leap is the keyword of the day. You are not likely to put up with any restraints today, real or imagined. This might lead you into trouble. Be careful around machinery. Realize all this if someone blows up at you completely out of the blue. Resist the urge to give in to your anger and throw a hissy fit."},
  {pn1: 4, pn2: 3, name: "Opposition", title: "Mars Opposite Venus", body: "You may rub the opposite sex the wrong way today. Little things you do may irritate them and you may come across as being rather boorish and uncouth. Not meaning any deliberate irritation, you may just come across in that manner. Perhaps you are hot and they are cold. Perhaps you are in the mood and they are not. Or vice versa. You and the people around you, especially those close to you, just don't seem to be on the same page. This will pass rather quickly. Being tender rather than aggressive can assuage the antagonisms. Try a little romance instead of brute force. Express your feminine side rather than your masculine side."},

It is a good time to bond emotionally with others and to nurture and be nurtured. Changes can be made quickly and decisively. Call your mother and tell her you love her. Energetic emotional expression and heightened physical vitality are the influences today."},

This is a good day to be involved in the arts, with music, painting or poetry, or with spiritual activities such as prayer or meditation. Energy can also be put to good use by getting involved with charity or volunteer work. Spiritual growth comes by helping others. Take time to contemplate your own inner thoughts. Insights can be gained."},

You may be inclined to promise more than you can deliver. Pull in your reins a little and don't expect too much. Stay in control of yourself and remember \"a man's got to know his limitations.\" Work off extra energy safely through physical exercise. Put off business deals until this aspect is over. Then, review your plans to make sure every thing is on the up and up. Don't be rash as this could lead to accidents. Take your time and be patient. Control your impulsive spending."},

But you are more likely to be headstrong and impulsive today, which could get you into trouble. You may feel restricted, but don't let this feeling get the better of you. Slow down, go get some exercise, and do your most important work when your hormones have slowed down a bit. Be careful around fire, sharp objects, and mechanical things. Don't push people around today. They are not receptive to your will. Avoid stress."},

Take time to think before you speak so that you don't end up with hoof (foot) in mouth disease. You may feel rash and headstrong today. Control your impulsiveness and your nervous energy. Slow down, take a few deep breaths, and relax. Read a book, write a poem, and realize that you don't have to verbally abuse people to get them to see things your way. Don't go looking for trouble today. Trouble will find you quick enough. Watch your offhand remarks. You may bum more people out than you think. Be careful driving or working on machinery.

Your emotions are running high and trouble will follow if you give in to your feelings, or your hormones. You are likely to tick people off even if you don't realize it. You may feel as if people are out to get you today. This is probably more in your imagination than in reality. Slow down. Haste makes waste. Be careful around hot water or fire. Don't let your moodiness get the better of you."},

You are probably extra sensitive today, so don't take offense where none is meant. If you are taking medication, remember that less is more because of your heightened sensitivity. Watch that people don't take advantage of you with a sob story or some deal that sounds too good to be true. Stay alert to people not telling you the whole story behind something. Take care of your physical self as your immune system might not be as strong today as usual."},

This could lead to head-butting instead of cooperation. You can accomplish a lot today, but do not do so by running roughshod over the feelings or ideas of others. Today is not the day to lock horns with the boss or those in authority. Cool your jets. How you handle opposition from others today will go a long way in determining just how successful your actions will be. Keep your nose clean today and avoid all underhanded tactics.

It will pass, but as long as it seems to be present, just keep your cool and remember the Golden Rule. Focus on the needs of others today and forget your own needs.

  {pn: 2, title: "Mercury Retrograde", body: "This is a transit lasting about 24 days, which normally occurs about 3 times a year. This transiting planet is more likely to trigger outer opportunities in your current experience rather than activate inner conditions. This can create frustrating conditions, delays, setbacks, or last-minute changes of plans according to your degree of susceptibility. It is not the best time for making important decisions or signing documents and papers that are expected to finalize a long-range commitment. You can expect all types of minor but irritating disruptions when dealing with any and all forms of communication or transport channels. The typical minor irritations to be found are those dealing with car repairs, telephone malfunctions, mix-ups in messages, mail delays, postponed deliveries, machinery breakdowns, suddenly cancelled appointments, or last minute alterations of previous plans and negotiations. Sometimes errors made in the past can now be brought to one's attention and corrected. This is a really good time for all mental activities such as research editing, revising written work, proof reading, etc. This is also a good time for meditation, in-depth self-analysis, and various forms of psychological techniques. New activities should be planned out in detail during this period but not executed, while unresolved matters from the past are best completed."},
  {pn: 3, title: "Venus Retrograde", body: "The retrograde transiting Venus period lasts for about 42 days. It occurs approximately every 11/2 years. This period most likely alters conditions involving our love impulses, attractions, conscious emotional response, personal values, and partnership considerations. It can also tie in with attitudes concerning current financial conditions and personal possessions. It is not an advisable time for entering a marriage or even beginning divorce proceedings, business partnerships, and all professional matters. Since Venus is also a money planet, this can suggest a poor time to make major financial purchases or investments. This is also not a good time for judging color, tints, and shades. On a constructive level, this can be an excellent period for reconsideration of all existing relationships in terms of their true value for you before reaching any final conclusions involving decisions or commitments. At this time you can establish better ways of balancing your monetary affairs for the future."},
  {pn: 4, title: "Mars Retrograde", body: "Transiting Mars turns retrograde for approximately 80 days, and happens every 2 years. When retrograde, it may seem as if your new plans backfire, lose expected momentum, develop too slowly, or fail to activate at all. This is not the best time for beginning activities that call for a prominent degree of enterprising effort, daring action, adventurous challenge, or constant and vigorous physical energy expenditure. Challenging experiences now are telling you that you have not aligned your energies properly and that you need to direct your physical attention to what you formerly neglected, or failed to carry through to completion. If already vulnerable to health disorders, you may experience problems involving your vitality during this transit, and often due to unrecognized temper, irritability, impatience, or frustration of drives. Complaints normally seen here involve inflammations, scrapes, burns, cuts or injuries due to sudden accidents. However this transiting phase is excellent for initiating the planning stage of any important project, or going back and reworking on previously initiated projects, finally finishing matters of the past. When used constructively this phase creates a period of opportunity to retrace your steps and reclaim something that is important to you.\r\n"},
  {pn: 5, title: "Jupiter Retrograde", body: "The Jupiter transiting retrograde phase lasts for 4 months and usually occurs once a year. This period acts more as an influence on your character, attitude, rather than events. This is not a good time to move towns or cities, to travel overseas, or to finalize any large financial or legal deals. On the positive side this phase is a good time for gaining deeper insights into spiritual or philosophical matters, as inner knowledge can flow more from the super conscious and can reach the conscious self. Look for the house in the natal chart to seek contentment. Belief in oneself is very strong although this is kept within and joviality may be subdued. When Jupiter turns direct again you will have adopted fresh new attitudes which can elevate you in a more purposefully and fulfilling way in your community. If Jupiter has other stressful aspects, inspirations may be stronger and intense, but these are not reliable and judgement could be faulty."},
  {pn: 6, title: "Saturn Retrograde", body: "This transit of retrograde Saturn phase is a period lasting approximately 4 1/2 months and occurs once a year. Saturn slows down your current activities so that you are given a better chance to become more efficient and start making sensible plans and methods enabling you to make the most later of any real endeavors. Global enterprises or expectations may undergo delays or unaccountable setbacks. Unforeseen commitments and responsibilities enter your life and demand your time and energy, as an example this could be \"unfinished business\" neglected previously and must now be attended to, before you can move ahead. Duties at hand must now be handled with patience, endurance, and inner steadiness. Saturn is teaching you to slow down, halt the ego, and become more thorough and organized. This is not a good time to make a career change or attempt to disrupt your status in the community, it is a better time to make adjustments or changes within your current position. Do not actively seek out extra obligations since they could prove more draining than anticipated. Work on your inner structures which are needed for psychological strength, which will later be of great assistance."},
  {pn: 7, title: "Uranus Retrograde", body: "Transiting retrograde Uranus lasts for about 155 days, once a year, therefore if it is likely to affect you personally one must look at the house it is transiting through as well as any aspects it is making in the natal chart. Only exacting aspects will apply with this transit. These effects will be immediately experienced as the disruption of the usual flow of affairs in the house it transits. Personal plans can be disrupted due to environmental conditions and throw your intentions of course. Structures quickly break down as situations challenge the status quo of activities. This transit can help put you in touch with needs for personal freedom of self expression that have been unfinished until this point in time. With this Uranus retrograde transit intuitive impulses turn inwardly and you may be able to stumble upon new ways of expression that would result greater self-illumination. You may not note much outwardly, but it will be stunning on your subjective levels and you will never see things quite the same way again in this area of your life. When mismanaged you may experience a period of strange mishaps which can rarely be analyzed or explained. The best way of using this period is to prompt you to look below the surface of matters to discover deeper, hidden causes previously ignored and to look at these matters in pure day light and objectivity. Uranus retrograde can give you great mental empowerment if you are willing to be honest and self-revealing about your life."},
  {pn: 8, title: "Neptune Retrograde", body: "Transiting retrograde Neptune lasts approximately 158 days and occurs once a year. Its primary influence will be experienced in the house it is transiting through. Since Neptune is characteristically subtle, evasive and is difficult to define in material terms all planetary aspects must be considered for this transit to be consciously understood. Much of this transit is theoretical and speculative and can only truly be understood by you on a deep level while you are in the transit. Retrograde transiting Neptune stirs up unresolved conditions from the past (even in this present life) that can emotionally change you psychologically. Neptune can trigger underground, often neglected feelings within you that run very deep. Try to be more reflective, and you will then be able to obtain inner guidance to allow you to and get in touch with these unsettled feelings. Because of the deceptive nature of Neptune outer structures are slowly weakening, losing support, and are becoming less stable, even if on the outside it may not seem so, and you should look deep inside of yourself for the answers. You will then recognize emotionally deprived parts of yourself that now need caring, compassionate concern. However you may have to experience a few of these transits as deeper layers of the self are penetrated."},
  {pn: 9, title: "Pluto Retrograde", body: "Retrograde transiting Pluto lasts about 160 days and occurs once a year. Its influence is concentrated on the house it transits through, although it moves so slowly that its affect may seem obscure to you. Pluto represents that part of your psyche that is often hard to find and understand and works on our deepest, underground levels of being. Pluto stops the external development of the house it passes through and forces you to focus on what you have failed securely to regenerate yourself during past transit cycles. The more aware you can become of this transit the less soul wrenching this transit will become. All you will seem to understand is that tensional matters from your past that were already disturbing enough, is to psychologically confront then once more as they are in your direct life path now and need to be re-examined. Pluto is only concerned with confronting us with the essence of that which you have not transformed to a higher level of expression. Pluto reasons this is your problem to work out, not Pluto's. From an objective point of view, this transit suggests that you have an opportunity, looking to the house involved, to back track your steps and find obvious sources of power (hidden) previously overlooked, that can now help you further your objectives in this area once well unearthed. You should look at the degree of discipline, emotional self-mastery, and even appetite-control at this time. This can be an excellent time for the self-aware person to apply penetrating insight towards opening those wayward parts of your inner self that now need a rebirth. Pluto in a retrograde transit can clearly clean out hidden weak spots with its probing abilities. Should you be lacking in self-awareness you will not be able to seek out the true potentials available at this time."}
